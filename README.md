This repo contains the code for both the published website and the tools used
to create the dataset.

#### Builder

The files under **builder/** are are not designed for production
use. They were scripts created to automate to process of collecting
data from Wikipedia. I also created a simple interface to link
different items, assign images, and review the quality of the information.

The data from **data/dump.sql** was used to produce the data in **public/data/json**
