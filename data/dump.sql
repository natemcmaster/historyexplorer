3	Intention	Intention is an agent's specific purpose in performing an action or series of actions, the end or goal that is aimed at. Outcomes that are not anticipated and not foreseen are known as unintended consequences.\nIntentional behavior can also be just thoughtful and deliberate goal-directedness. Recent research in experimental philosophy has shown that other factors may also matter for whether or not an action is counted as intentional.\n\n	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intention	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/People_icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg"]	f	cover
198	Catherine the Great	Yekaterina Alexeevna or Catherine II, also known as Catherine the Great (Russian: Екатерина II Великая, Yekaterina II Velikaya; German: Katharina die Große; 2 May [O.S. 21 April] 1729 – 17 November [O.S. 6 November] 1796), was the most renowned and the longest-ruling female leader of Russia, reigning from 9 July [O.S. 28 June] 1762 until her death in 1796 at the age of sixty-seven. Her reign was called Russia's golden age. She was born in Stettin, Pomerania, Prussia as Sophie Friederike Auguste von Anhalt-Zerbst-Dornburg, and came to power following a coup d'état and the assassination of her husband, Peter III, at the end of the Seven Years' War. Russia was revitalized under her reign, growing larger and stronger than ever and becoming recognized as one of the great powers of Europe.\nIn both her accession to power and in rule of her empire, Catherine often relied on her noble favourites, most notably Grigory Orlov and Grigory Potemkin. Assisted by highly successful generals such as Pyotr Rumyantsev and Alexander Suvorov, and admirals such as Fyodor Ushakov, she governed at a time when the Russian Empire was expanding rapidly by conquest and diplomacy. In the south, the Crimean Khanate was crushed following victories over the Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish wars, and Russia colonised the vast territories of Novorossiya along the coasts of the Black and Azov Seas. In the west, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, ruled by Catherine's former lover, king Stanisław August Poniatowski, was eventually partitioned, with the Russian Empire gaining the largest share. In the east, Russia started to colonise Alaska, establishing Russian America.\nCatherine reformed the administration of Russian guberniyas, and many new cities and towns were founded on her orders. An admirer of Peter the Great, Catherine continued to modernise Russia along Western European lines. However, military conscription and economy continued to depend on serfdom, and the increasing demands of the state and private landowners led to increased levels of reliance on serfs. This was one of the chief reasons behind several rebellions, including the large-scale Pugachev's Rebellion of cossacks and peasants.\nThe period of Catherine the Great's rule, the Catherinian Era, is often considered the Golden Age of the Russian Empire and the Russian nobility. The Manifesto on Freedom of the Nobility, issued during the short reign of Peter III and confirmed by Catherine, freed Russian nobles from compulsory military or state service. Construction of many mansions of the nobility, in the classical style endorsed by the Empress, changed the face of the country. A notable example of enlightened despot, a correspondent of Voltaire and an amateur opera librettist, Catherine presided over the age of the Russian Enlightenment, when the Smolny Institute, the first state-financed higher education institution for women in Europe, was established.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_the_Great	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/56/Empress_Catherine_The_Great_circa_1845_%28George_Christoph_Grooth%29.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/78/Empress_Catherine_The_Great_1787_%28Mikhail_Shibanov%29.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d8/Catherine_II_on_horse.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Wiki_Moscow_Orphanage%2C_Moskvoretskaya_Embankment.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Stanis%C5%82aw_II_August_Poniatowski_in_coronation_clothes.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Taming-of-the-Shrew-Gillray.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Levitzky_Portrait_Catherine_II_1782.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Orlov_greg.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Paul_i_russia.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Rokotov_Portrait_Catherine_II.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Johann-Baptist_Lampi_d._%C3%84._007.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Katharina_II.%2C_die_Gro%C3%9Fe.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Kingsobor.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Lesser_Coat_of_Arms_of_Russian_Empire.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Catherine_The_Great_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Catherine_II_of_Russia_by_Vigilius_Eriksen_-_%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%82_%D0%95%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%8B_%D0%92%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B9._-_1762.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Crown_of_Saint_Edward_Heraldry.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Coat_of_arms_of_Russia_%28XV_Century%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Dmitry_Levitsky_-_%D0%95%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0_II_%D0%B2_%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B5_%D0%97%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%86%D1%8B_%D0%B2_%D1%85%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B5_%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8_%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%8F_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Denkmal_f%C3%BCr_Katharina_II._in_St._Petersburg.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Imperial_Coat_of_arms_of_Russia_%2817th_century%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Galaktionov_Smolny_institute_1823.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Jacobi_InaguarationofAcademy.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Imperial_Monogram_Of_Empress_Catherine_The_Great_Of_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/%D0%A1%D0%BA%D1%83%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BF%D1%82%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B0_%D0%95%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%8B_II_%D0%B2_%22%D0%A0%D1%83%D1%81%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC_%D0%9C%D1%83%D0%B7%D0%B5%D0%B5%22%2C_%D0%B3.%D0%A1%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BA%D1%82-%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B3_%282%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Zar_Pavel_1.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Vorontsova-Dashkova.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Antropov_PeterIII.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Anna_Petrovna%27s_grave%2C_Blagoveschenskaya_church_01_by_shakko.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Cath2russia.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Caravaque_catherine.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/1000_Potiomkin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Alexei_borinsky.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/5_Kopecks_repr%C3%A9sentant_l%27aigle_bic%C3%A9phale_et_le_monogramme_de_Catherine_II%2C_1791.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Catherine03.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Catherine02.jpg"]	f	cover
201	Maria Theresa	Maria Theresa Walburga Amalia Christina (German: Maria Theresia; 13 May 1717 – 29 November 1780) was the only female ruler of the Habsburg dominions and the last of the House of Habsburg. She was the sovereign of Austria, Hungary, Croatia, Bohemia, Mantua, Milan, Lodomeria and Galicia, the Austrian Netherlands and Parma. By marriage, she was Duchess of Lorraine, Grand Duchess of Tuscany and Holy Roman Empress.\nShe started her 40-year reign when her father, Emperor Charles VI, died in October 1740. Charles VI paved the way for her accession with the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 and spent his entire reign securing it. Upon the death of her father, Saxony, Prussia, Bavaria, and France all repudiated the sanction they had recognised during his lifetime. Prussia proceeded to invade the affluent Habsburg province of Silesia, sparking a nine-year conflict known as the War of the Austrian Succession, and subsequently conquered it. Maria Theresa would later unsuccessfully try to reconquer Silesia during the Seven Years' War.\nMaria Theresa and her husband, Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor, had sixteen children, including Queen Marie Antoinette of France, Queen Maria Carolina of Naples, Duchess Maria Amalia of Parma and two Holy Roman Emperors, Joseph II and Leopold II. Though she was expected to cede power to Francis and Joseph, both of whom were officially her co-rulers in Austria and Bohemia, Maria Theresa was the absolute sovereign who ruled by the counsel of her advisers. She criticised and disapproved of many of Joseph's actions. Although she is considered to have been intellectually inferior to both Joseph and Leopold, Maria Theresa understood the importance of her public persona and was able to simultaneously evoke both esteem and affection from her subjects.\nMaria Theresa promulgated financial and educational reforms, with the assistance of Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Haugwitz and Gerard van Swieten, promoted commerce and the development of agriculture, and reorganised Austria's ramshackle military, all of which strengthened Austria's international standing. However, she refused to allow religious toleration and contemporary travellers thought her regime was bigoted and superstitious. As a young monarch who fought two dynastic wars, she believed that her cause should be the cause of her subjects, but in her later years she would believe that their cause must be hers.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Theresa	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/10/Signature_Maria_Theresa.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Marie_elizabeth.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Maximilian_Franz_Austria_1756_1801_portrait.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Maria_Theresia_Familie.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Mariatheresiaoldfamily.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Marie167.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Marie_Karoline_von_%C3%96sterreich.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Maria_Josepha_of_Austria_-_Anton_Raphael_Mengs_-_1767.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Maria_Theresa_and_Francis_Wedding_Breakfast_by_Martin_van_Meytens_ca_1736.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Maria_Theresa_of_Austria_family.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Maria_Theresia11.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Johann_Daniel_Donat%2C_Emperor_Leopold_II_in_the_Regalia_of_the_Golden_Fleece_%281806%29.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Johann_Daniel_Donat%2C_Emperor_Leopold_II_in_the_Regalia_of_the_Golden_Fleece_%281806%29.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Johanna_Gabriele_of_Habsburg_Lorraine.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Johann_Zoffany_004.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Kaiserin_Maria_Theresia_%28HRR%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Kaisergruft_2286201074_fdea9c4cfa_b.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/MariaKarolina1740.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/MariaElizabeth1737-1740.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Maria_Amalia_of_Austria_by_Roslin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/MariaKarolinadeHasburgo-Lorena.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Znak_%C4%8Desk%C3%A9ho_kr%C3%A1lovstv%C3%AD.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Wappen_Kaiserin_Maria_Theresia_1765_%28Mittel%29.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Schlacht-Kolin-1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Parma_und_Piacenza-Stroehl.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Oath_of_Fealty_to_Maria_Theresa.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/M%C3%A1ria_Ter%C3%A9zia_koron%C3%A1z%C3%A1sa_a_Szent_M%C3%A1rton_sz%C3%A9kesegyh%C3%A1zban.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Middle_Coat_of_Arms_of_Maria_Theresa%2C_Holy_Roman_Empress.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Archduke_Karl_Joseph_%281745%E2%80%931761%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Archduchess_Maria_Anne_of_Austria.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Coa_Hungary_Country_History_%2814th_century%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Arms_of_Luxembourg.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Andreas_Moeller_001.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Anton_von_Maron_006.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Anton_von_Maron_005.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Ferdinand_Karl_of_Habsburg_Lorraine.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Coat_of_arms_Henri_I_of_Luxembourg_middle.png"]	f	cover
4	Continuance	In American procedural law, a continuance is the postponement of a hearing, trial, or other scheduled court proceeding at the request of either or both parties in the dispute, or by the judge sua sponte. In response to delays in bringing cases to trial, some states have adopted "fast-track" rules that sharply limit the ability of judges to grant continuances. 	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuance	[]	f	cover

7	Dante Alighieri	Durante degli Alighieri, simply referred to as Dante (UK /ˈdænti/, US /ˈdɑːnteɪ/; Italian: [ˈdante]; c. 1265–1321), was a major Italian poet of the Middle Ages. His Divine Comedy, originally called Comedìa and later called Divina by Boccaccio, is widely considered the greatest literary work composed in the Italian language and a masterpiece of world literature.\nIn Italy he is known as il Sommo Poeta ("the Supreme Poet") or just il Poeta. He, Petrarch and Boccaccio are also known as "the three fountains" or "the three crowns". Dante is also called "the Father of the Italian language".	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f7/DanteDetail.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Alighieri	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f7/DanteDetail.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Santa_Croce_Firenze_Apr_2008_%2817%29.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Portrait_de_Dante.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Statue_of_Dante%2C_Verona.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Thomas_Aquinas_in_Stained_Glass.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Wikidata-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/03/Flag_of_Italy.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Dante_Alighieri01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/DanteFresco.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Dante_alighieri%2C_Palazzo_dei_Giudici.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Dante_Luca.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Books-aj.svg_aj_ashton_01.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a0/Dante_Statue.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Dante.deathmask.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Dante-alighieri.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Office-book.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Dantes_tomb_ravenna.jpg"]	f	cover

13	Overlap	HTML or HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language used to create web pages.\nHTML is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets (like <html>). HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like <h1> and </h1>, although some tags represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example <img>. The first tag in a pair is the start tag, and the second tag is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags). Though not always necessary, it is best practice to append a slash to tags which are not paired with a closing tag.\nThe purpose of a web browser is to read HTML documents and compose them into visible or audible web pages. The browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses the tags to interpret the content of the page. HTML describes the structure of a website semantically along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language rather than a programming language.\nHTML elements form the building blocks of all websites. HTML allows images and objects to be embedded and can be used to create interactive forms. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. It can embed scripts written in languages such as JavaScript which affect the behavior of HTML web pages.\nWeb browsers can also refer to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to define the look and layout of text and other material. The W3C, maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, encourages the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlap	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/HTML5_logo_and_wordmark.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/HTML5_logo_and_wordmark.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Tim_Berners-Lee_April_2009.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Old_HTML_Logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Crystal_Clear_app_browser.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/HTML.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Crystal_Clear_device_cdrom_unmount.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Wikiversity-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg"]	f	cover
209	William Pitt the Younger	William Pitt the Younger (28 May 1759 – 23 January 1806) was a British politician of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. He became the youngest Prime Minister in 1783 at the age of 24. He left office in 1801, but was Prime Minister again from 1804 until his death in 1806. He was also the Chancellor of the Exchequer throughout his premiership, and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports from August 1792. He is known as "the Younger" to distinguish him from his father, William Pitt the Elder, who had previously served as Prime Minister.\nThe younger Pitt's prime ministerial tenure, which came during the reign of George III, was dominated by major events in Europe, including the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. Pitt, although often referred to as a Tory, or "new Tory", called himself an "independent Whig" and was generally opposed to the development of a strict partisan political system.\nHe is best known for leading Britain in the great wars against France and Napoleon. Pitt was an outstanding administrator who worked for efficiency and reform, bringing in a new generation of outstanding administrators. He raised taxes to pay for the great war against France, and cracked down on radicalism. To meet the threat of Irish support for France, he engineered the Acts of Union 1800 and tried (but failed) to get Catholic Emancipation as part of the Union. Pitt created the "new Toryism", which revived the Tory Party and enabled it to stay in power for the next quarter-century.\nHistorian Asa Briggs points out that his personality did not endear itself to the British mind, for Pitt was too solitary, too colourless, and too often exuded superiority. His greatness came in the war with France, with the adversary setting the pace. Pitt reacted to become what Lord Minto called "the Atlas of our reeling globe". His integrity and industry and his role as defender of the threatened nation allowed him to inspire and access all the national reserves of strength. William Wilberforce said that, "For personal purity, disinterestedness and love of this country, I have never known his equal." Historian Charles Petrie concludes that he was one of the greatest prime ministers "if on no other ground than that he enabled the country to pass from the old order to the new without any violent upheaval....He understood the new Britain." For this he is ranked highly amongst British Prime Ministers.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Pitt_the_Younger	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/William_Pitt_the_Younger_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/OlderPittThe_Younger.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/National-Debt-Gillray.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28HM_Government%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Pitt_the_Younger.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Britannia-between-Death-and-the-Doctors-Gillray.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/William_Pitt_by_Joseph_Nollekens_1807.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Integrity-retiring-from-Office-Gillray.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/George_Street_Pitt_04.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/William_Pitt_the_Younger_at_Westminster.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Uncorking-Old-Sherry-Gillray.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/William_Pitt_the_Younger_Signature.svg"]	f	cover
278	Franz Schubert	Franz Peter Schubert (German pronunciation: [ˈfʁant͡s ˈʃuːbɐt]; 31 January 1797 – 19 November 1828) was an Austrian composer.\nIn a short lifespan of less than 32 years, Schubert was a prolific composer, writing some 600 Lieder, ten complete or nearly complete symphonies, liturgical music, operas, incidental music and a large body of chamber and solo piano music. Appreciation of his music while he was alive was limited to a relatively small circle of admirers in Vienna, but interest in his work increased significantly in the decades immediately after his death. Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann, Franz Liszt, Johannes Brahms and other 19th-century composers discovered and championed his works. Today, Schubert is ranked among the greatest composers of the early Romantic era and, as such, is one of the most frequently performed composers of the early nineteenth century.	\N	\N	\N	http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/madduci/3A/schubert.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Schubert	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Schubert_-_Piano_Sonatas_-_8_Allegro.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Schubert_Franz.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Schubert_-_Arpeggione_Sonata_-_2._Adagio_and_3._Allegretto.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Schubert_-_Piano_Sonatas_-_5_Moderato.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Schubert_-_Piano_Sonatas_-_6_Andante.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Schubert_-_Piano_Sonatas_-_7_Scherzo.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Schubert-mass_in_g._5._benedictus.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Schubert-mass_in_g._6._agnus_dei.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/SchubertAndVogl.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/Schubert_-_Arpeggione_Sonata_-_1._Allegro_Moderato.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Franz_Schubert.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Franz_Schubert_by_Wilhelm_August_Rieder_1875.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Franz_Schubert_by_Wilhelm_August_Rieder.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Franz_Schubert_c1827.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Schubert-m.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Schubert%27s_Brille.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Schubert-mass_in_g._2._gloria.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Schubert-mass_in_g._1._kyrie.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Schubert-mass_in_g._4._sanctus.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Schubert-mass_in_g._3._credo.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Wien_Geburtshaus_Franz_Schubert.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Schubert_Haus00.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Franz_Schubert_-_fantasy_in_c_major_op.15_d.760_%27wanderer%27_-_i._allegro_con_fuoco.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Franz_Schubert_-_Rondeau_brillant.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Franz_Schubert_-_fantasy_in_c_major_op.15_d.760_%27wanderer%27_-_iii._presto.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Franz_Schubert_-_fantasy_in_c_major_op.15_d.760_%27wanderer%27_-_ii._adagio.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Austria_50_Schilling_1978_Reverse._KM_2937.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Franz_Schubert_-_Fantasy_in_C_major_for_violin_and_piano.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Franz_Schubert_-_Ellens_dritter_Gesang.oga", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Schubert-_Impromptu_B-flat.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Franz_Schubert_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Franz_Schubert_-_fantasy_in_c_major_op.15_d.760_%27wanderer%27_-_iv._allegro.ogg"]	f	cover
21	Niccolò Machiavelli	Niccolò di Bernardo dei Machiavelli (Italian: [nikkoˈlɔ makjaˈvɛlli]; 3 May 1469 – 21 June 1527) was an Italian historian, politician, diplomat, philosopher, humanist, and writer based in Florence during the Renaissance. He was for many years an official in the Florentine Republic, with responsibilities in diplomatic and military affairs. He was a founder of modern political science, and more specifically political ethics. He also wrote comedies, carnival songs, and poetry. His personal correspondence is renowned in the Italian language. He was Secretary to the Second Chancery of the Republic of Florence from 1498 to 1512, when the Medici were out of power. He wrote his masterpiece, The Prince, after the Medici had recovered power and he no longer held a position of responsibility in Florence.\n"Machiavellianism" is a widely used negative term to characterize unscrupulous politicians of the sort Machiavelli described in The Prince. The book itself gained enormous notoriety and wide readership because the author seemed to be endorsing behavior often deemed as evil and immoral.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Santi_di_Tito_-_Niccolo_Machiavelli%27s_portrait_headcrop.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Machiavelli	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/03/Flag_of_Italy.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Santi_di_Tito_-_Niccolo_Machiavelli%27s_portrait_headcrop.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Xenophon.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Francis_Bacon.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Duke-Lorenzo.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Machiavelli_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Machiavel_Offices_Florence.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Art_of_War-1573.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Cesareborgia.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Cesare_borgia-Machiavelli-Corella.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Santa_Croce_Firenze_Apr_2008_%2820%29.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Portrait_of_Niccol%C3%B2_Machiavelli_by_Santi_di_Tito.jpg"]	f	90%

Berlioz made significant contributions to the modern orchestra with his Treatise on Instrumentation. He specified huge orchestral forces for some of his works, and conducted several concerts with more than 1,000 musicians. He also composed around 50 songs. His influence was critical for the further development of Romanticism, especially in composers like Richard Wagner, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Franz Liszt, Richard Strauss, Gustav Mahler and many others.	\N	\N	\N	http://cdn1.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/images/louis-hector-berlioz.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hector_Berlioz	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Hector_Berlioz.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Harrietsmithson.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Hector_Berlioz_Crop.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Berlioz_image_03.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Berlioz_engraving.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Berlioz_young.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Berlioz_in1868.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Berlioz8.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Hector_Berlioz_-_roman_carnival_overture%2C_op._9.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Berlioz_choir.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Berlioz_Petit_BNF_Gallica.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Office-book.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Gnome-mime-audio-openclipart.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Berliozs_manuscript_of_first_page_of_Symphonie_Fantastique.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Legros_-_Berlioz_%28dessin%29.jpg"]	f	cover
56	St. Bartholomew's Day massacre	The St. Bartholomew's Day massacre (Massacre de la Saint-Barthélemy in French) in 1572 was a targeted group of assassinations, followed by a wave of Roman Catholic mob violence, both directed against the Huguenots (French Calvinist Protestants), during the French Wars of Religion. Traditionally believed to have been instigated by Catherine de' Medici, the mother of King Charles IX, the massacre took place five days after the wedding of the king's sister Margaret to the Protestant Henry III of Navarre (the future Henry IV of France). This marriage was an occasion for which many of the most wealthy and prominent Huguenots had gathered in largely Catholic Paris.\nThe massacre began in the night of 23-24 August 1572 (the eve of the feast of Bartholomew the Apostle), two days after the attempted assassination of Admiral Gaspard de Coligny, the military and political leader of the Huguenots. The king ordered the killing of a group of Huguenot leaders, including Coligny, and the slaughter spread throughout Paris. Lasting several weeks, the massacre expanded outward to other urban centres and the countryside. Modern estimates for the number of dead across France vary widely, from 5,000 to 30,000.\nThe massacre also marked a turning point in the French Wars of Religion. The Huguenot political movement was crippled by the loss of many of its prominent aristocratic leaders, as well as many re-conversions by the rank and file, and those who remained were increasingly radicalized. Though by no means unique, it "was the worst of the century's religious massacres." Throughout Europe, it "printed on Protestant minds the indelible conviction that Catholicism was a bloody and treacherous religion".	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Bartholomew%27s_Day_massacre	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Huns_003.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Huguenot_lovers_on_St._Bartholomew%27s_Day.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Catherine_de_Medicis.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Frans_Hogenberg%2C_The_St._Bartholomew%27s_Day_massacre%2C_circa_1572.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Francois_Dubois_001.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Giorgio_Vasari_San_Bartolomeo.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Fran%C3%A7ois_Clouet_-_Admiral_Gaspard_II_de_Coligny.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/CharlesIX.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Le_Siege_de_La_Rochelle_par_le_Duc_d_Anjou_en_1573.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Debat-Ponsan-matin-Louvre.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Charles_IX_in_front_of_the_Paris_Parliament_on_26_August_1572_attempting_to_justify_the_Saint_Bartholomew_massacre_as_a_response_to_a_Huguenot_plot.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Henry%2C_third_duke_of_Guise.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Gregory_XIII_medal.jpg"]	f	cover

283	Giuseppe Verdi	Giuseppe Fortunino Francesco Verdi (Italian: [d͡ʒuˈzɛppe ˈverdi]; 9 or 10 October 1813 – 27 January 1901) was an Italian Romantic composer primarily known for his operas. He is considered, together with Richard Wagner, the preeminent opera composer of the nineteenth century. Verdi dominated the Italian opera scene after the eras of Bellini, Donizetti and Rossini. His works are frequently performed in opera houses throughout the world and, transcending the boundaries of the genre, some of his themes have long since taken root in popular culture, as "La donna è mobile" from Rigoletto, "Libiamo ne' lieti calici" (The Drinking Song) from La traviata, "Va, pensiero" (The Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves) from Nabucco, the "Coro di zingari" (Anvil Chorus) from Il trovatore and the "Grand March" from Aida.\nMoved by the death of compatriot Alessandro Manzoni, Verdi wrote Messa da Requiem in 1874 in Manzoni's honour, a work now regarded as a masterpiece of the oratorio tradition and a testimony to his capacity outside the field of opera. Visionary and politically engaged, he remains – alongside Garibaldi and Cavour – an emblematic figure of the reunification process of the Italian peninsula (the Risorgimento).	\N	\N	\N	http://www.iconsofeurope.com/verdigiuseppe.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Verdi	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c6/Final_scene_from_the_opera_Risorgimento%21.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Enrico_Caruso%2C_Giuseppe_de_Luca%2C_Giuseppe_Verdi%2C_N%C3%A8_gustare_m%27%C3%A8_dato_un%27ora_%28La_forza_del_destino%29.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Enrico_Caruso%2C_Titta_Ruffo%2C_Giuseppe_Verdi%2C_S%C3%AC%2C_pel_ciel_marmoreo_giuro%21_%28Otello%29.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Caruso_et_al_-_%C3%88_scherzo_od_%C3%A8_follia.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Verdi-photo-Brogi.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Verdi-Delfico-1860.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Verdi_palermo_bust_200805.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Verdi.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Verdi_statue.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Gabriella_Besanzoni%2C_Giuseppi_Verdi%2C_Stride_la_vampa_%28Il_Trovatore%29.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/La_Donna_E_Mobile_Rigoletto.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Gnome-mime-audio-openclipart.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Margherita_Barezzi.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Lucrezia_Bori%2C_Giuseppe_Verdi%2C_Ah%21_fors%27_e_lui_%28La_traviata%29.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/GiuseppeVerdi.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Giuseppe_Verdi_signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Giuseppe_Verdi00.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Enrico_Caruso%2C_Bessie_Abott%2C_Louise_Homer%2C_Antonio_Scotti%2C_Giuseppe_Verdi%2C_Bella_figlia_dell%27_amore_%28Rigoletto%29.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Mattia_Battistini%2C_Emilia_Corsi%2C_Luigi_Colazza%2C_Aristodemo_Sillich%2C_Giuseppi_Verdi%2C_O_sommo_Carlo_%28Ernani%29.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Marie_Rappold_performing_O_Patria_Mia_from_Aida.ogg"]	f	80%
231	Patriot (American Revolution)	Patriots (also known as Rebels, Revolutionaries, Congress-Men, or American Whigs) were those colonists of the British Thirteen United Colonies that violently rebelled against British control during the American Revolution and in July 1776 declared the United States of America an independent nation. Their rebellion was based on the political philosophy of republicanism, as expressed by pamphleteers, such as Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, and Thomas Paine.\nAs a group, Patriots represented a wide array of social, economic, ethnic and racial backgrounds. They included lawyers like John Adams and Alexander Hamilton; planters like Thomas Jefferson and George Mason; merchants like Alexander McDougall and ordinary farmers like Daniel Shays and Joseph Plumb Martin.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_(American_Revolution)	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Padlock-silver-light.svg"]	f	cover

235	Battle of Trenton	The Battle of Trenton took place on the morning of December 26, 1776, during the American Revolutionary War, after General George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River north of Trenton, New Jersey. The hazardous crossing in adverse weather made it possible for Washington to lead the main body of the Continental Army against Hessian soldiers garrisoned at Trenton. After a brief battle, nearly the entire Hessian force was captured, with negligible losses to the Americans. The battle significantly boosted the Continental Army's flagging morale, and inspired reenlistments.\nThe Continental Army had previously suffered several defeats in New York and had been forced to retreat through New Jersey to Pennsylvania. Morale in the army was low; to end the year on a positive note, George Washington—Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army—devised a plan to cross the Delaware River on the night of December 25–26 and surround the Hessian garrison.\nBecause the river was icy and the weather severe, the crossing proved dangerous. Two detachments were unable to cross the river, leaving Washington with only 2,400 men under his command in the assault. The army marched 9 miles (14 km) south to Trenton. The Hessians had lowered their guard, thinking they were safe from the American army, and had no long-distance outposts or patrols. Washington's forces caught them off guard and, after a short but fierce resistance, most of the Hessians surrendered. Almost two thirds of the 1,500-man garrison was captured, and only a few troops escaped across Assunpink Creek.\nDespite the battle's small numbers, the American victory inspired rebels in the colonies. With the success of the revolution in doubt a week earlier, the army had seemed on the verge of collapse. The dramatic victory inspired soldiers to serve longer and attracted new recruits to the ranks.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/The_Capture_of_the_Hessians_at_Trenton_December_26_1776.jpeg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Trenton	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Battle_of_Trenton.Dean.USMA.edu.history.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Washingtons_Crossing_Park_Cannon.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Flag_of_Hesse.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Battle_of_Trenton_by_Charles_McBarron.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Henry-revolutionary-war.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Grand_Union_Flag.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/1819_Passage_OfThe_Delaware_byThomasSully_MFABoston.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Battle-trenton-sketch-rochambeau.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Battle-of-Trenton.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Washington_Crossing_the_Delaware_by_Emanuel_Leutze%2C_MMA-NYC%2C_1851.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/The_Capture_of_the_Hessians_at_Trenton_December_26_1776.jpeg"]	f	cover
240	Nobles of the Sword	The Nobles of the Sword (French: noblesse d'épée) refers to the class of traditional or old nobility in France during the Middle Ages and the Early Modern periods. This class was heir to a militaristic ideology of professional chivalry. It is largely synonymous with the expressions noblesse de race and noblesse ancienne, and is used in opposition to other classes of French nobility, namely:\nnoblesse de chancellerie - chancellor nobility made noble by holding certain high offices for the king\nnoblesse de lettres - person made noble by "lettres patentes" from the king\nnoblesse de robe (nobility of the gown) - person or family made noble by holding certain official charges, like maître des requêtes, treasurer or president of a provincial parlement\nnoblesse de cloche (nobility of the "bell") or noblesse échevinale - person or family made noble by being a mayor or "échevin" or "prévôt des marchands" (municipal leader) in certain towns (such as Angers, Angoulême, Bourges, Lyon, Toulouse, Paris, Perpignan, Poitiers)\nnoblesse militaire - person made noble through military position\nAs with officer of the sword, the expression derives from the right of nobles to wear a sword.\nTo be considered a noble of the sword, a nominee had to be a fourth generation noble. During the Renaissance, the nobles of the sword provided services for the monarchy, finding positions in all branches of government. This was beneficial for the monarchy by reducing the potential for the nobility to revolt against it. The nobility of the sword often had members in the military, so maintaining good connections with the nobles not only ensured they would not revolt against the monarchy, but they would support it militarily. Recognizing the importance of maintaining strong relations with the monarch, many nobles remained at court rather than at their appointed seats so they could continue courting the good will of the king.	\N	\N	\N	http://www.medieval-spell.com/Images/Teutonic-Knights/Master-Sword.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobles_of_the_Sword	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Hourglass_drawing.svg"]	f	contain
491	Peter Tchaikovsky	Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (/ˈpjɔːtər ɪˈliɪtʃ tʃɪˈkɒfski/; Russian: Пётр Ильи́ч Чайко́вский; tr. Pyotr Ilyich Chaykovsky; 7 May 1840 – 6 November 1893), often anglicised as Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky /ˈpiːtər .../, was a Russian composer whose works included symphonies, concertos, operas, ballets, chamber music, and a choral setting of the Russian Orthodox Divine Liturgy. Some of these are among the most popular theatrical music in the classical repertoire. He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally, which he bolstered with appearances as a guest conductor later in his career in Europe and the United States. One of these appearances was at the inaugural concert of Carnegie Hall in New York City in 1891. Tchaikovsky was honored in 1884 by Emperor Alexander III, and awarded a lifetime pension in the late 1880s.\nAlthough musically precocious, Tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a civil servant. There was scant opportunity for a musical career in Russia at that time, and no system of public music education. When an opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five, with whom his professional relationship was mixed. Tchaikovsky's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood. From this reconciliation, he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style—a task that did not prove easy. The principles that governed melody, harmony and other fundamentals of Russian music ran completely counter to those that governed Western European music; this seemed to defeat the potential for using Russian music in large-scale Western composition or from forming a composite style, and it caused personal antipathies that dented Tchaikovsky's self-confidence. Russian culture exhibited a split personality, with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of Peter the Great, and this resulted in uncertainty among the intelligentsia of the country's national identity.\nDespite his many popular successes, Tchaikovsky's life was punctuated by personal crises and depression. Contributory factors included his leaving his mother for boarding school, his mother's early death, as well as that of his close friend and colleague Nikolai Rubinstein, and the collapse of the one enduring relationship of his adult life, his 13-year association with the wealthy widow Nadezhda von Meck. His homosexuality, which he kept private, has traditionally also been considered a major factor, though some musicologists now downplay its importance. His sudden death at the age of 53 is generally ascribed to cholera; there is an ongoing debate as to whether it was accidental or self-inflicted.\nWhile his music has remained popular among audiences, critical opinions were initially mixed. Some Russians did not feel it sufficiently representative of native musical values and were suspicious that Europeans accepted it for its Western elements. In apparent reinforcement of the latter claim, some Europeans lauded Tchaikovsky for offering music more substantive than base exoticism, and thus transcending stereotypes of Russian classical music. Tchaikovsky's music was dismissed as "lacking in elevated thought," according to longtime New York Times music critic Harold C. Schonberg, and its formal workings were derided as deficient for not following Western principles stringently.	\N	\N	\N	http://www.classicalarchives.com/images/cpic/pic200/drz000/z000/z000706mkiz.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Tchaikovksy%27s_signature.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Sequence_ascending_from_C_tonal.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Sleeping_beauty_cast.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Sonata_form_pyramid.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Robert_Schumann_1839.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Ru-Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Rubinstein_N_%26_A_Postcard-1910.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Sequence_ascending_from_C_tonal.mid", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Lesser_Coat_of_Arms_of_Russian_Empire.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Hanslick.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Marius_Ivanovich_Petipa_-Feb._14_1898.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Nuvola_LGBT_flag_borderless.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Modest_Tchaikovsky_Oval.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Pjotr_T%C5%A1aikovskin_kotimuseo.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Operalogo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky_-_romeo_and_juliet-_overture-fantasy.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky_-_1812_overture.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Youngtchaik.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Von_Meck.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Uchilische_pravovedenia.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Tchaikovsky%2C_Pyotr_Ilyich_-_Twelve_Pieces_for_piano%2C_Opus_40_%28extract%29.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Tchaikowsky_%26_Anton_Rubinstein_%26_friends%281890%29.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Tchaikovskys_family_in_1848_From_left_to_right_sitting_Alexandra_Andreevna_Tchaikovska_Alexandra_Ippolit_Ilya_Petrovitch_Tchai_Family_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Tchaikovsky_with_wife_Antonina_Miliukova.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Tchaikovsky_1906_Evans.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Tchaikovsky%2C_Pyotr_Ilyich_-_Twelve_Pieces_for_piano%2C_Opus_40_%28extract%29.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Circle_of_fifths_deluxe_4.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Ballerina-icon.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Fyodor_Mikhailovich_Dostoyevsky_1876.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9e_Art%C3%B4t.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Alexander_III._Czar_Of_Russia_Nadar.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Balakirev_from_1914_Windsor_Magazine.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Audio_a.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Hans_von_buelow.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg"]	f	65%

496	Utilitarianism	Utilitarianism is a theory in normative ethics holding that the proper course of action is the one that maximizes utility, usually defined as maximizing happiness and reducing suffering. Classic utilitarianism's two most influential contributors are Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. John Stuart Mill in his book Utilitarianism, stated, "In the golden rule of Jesus of Nazareth, we read the complete spirit of the ethics of utility. To do as one would be done by, and to love one's neighbour as oneself, constitute the ideal perfection of utilitarian morality." According to Bentham and Mill, utilitarianism is hedonistic only when the result of an action has no decidedly negative impact on others. It is now generally taken to be a form of consequentialism, although when Anscombe first introduced that term it was to distinguish between "old-fashioned utilitarianism" and consequentialism. In utilitarianism, the moral worth of an action is determined only by its resulting outcome, although there is debate over how much consideration should be given to actual consequences, foreseen consequences and intended consequences. In A Fragment on Government, Bentham says, "it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong" and describes this as a fundamental axiom. In An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation, he talks of "the principle of utility" but later prefers "the greatest happiness principle."\nUtilitarianism can be characterized as a quantitative and reductionist approach to ethics. It is a type of naturalism. It can be contrasted with deontological ethics, which does not regard the consequences of an act as a determinant of its moral worth; virtue ethics, which primarily focuses on acts and habits leading to happiness; pragmatic ethics; as well as with ethical egoism and other varieties of consequentialism.\nUtilitarianism is influential in political philosophy. Bentham and Mill believed that a utilitarian government was achievable through democracy. Mill thought that despotism was also justifiable through utilitarianism as a transitional phase towards more democratic forms of governance. As an advocate of liberalism, Mill stressed the relationship between utilitarianism and individualism.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d3/Modern_Utiitarianism_by_Birks.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Jeremy_Bentham_by_Henry_William_Pickersgill_detail.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Peter_Singer_MIT_Veritas.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/People_icon.svg"]	f	cover
50	Canton (country subdivision)	A canton is a type of administrative division of a country. In general, cantons are relatively small in terms of area and population when compared to other administrative divisions such as counties, departments or provinces. Internationally the best-known cantons, and the most politically important, are those of Switzerland. As the constituents of the Swiss Confederation, theoretically (and historically) the Swiss cantons are semi-sovereign states.\nThe term is derived from the French word canton meaning corner or district (from which "Cantonment" is also derived).	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton_(country_subdivision)	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Armillary_sphere.png"]	f	cover
492	Romeo and Juliet	Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare early in his career about two young star-crossed lovers whose deaths ultimately reconcile their feuding families. It was among Shakespeare's most popular plays during his lifetime and, along with Hamlet, is one of his most frequently performed plays. Today, the title characters are regarded as archetypal young lovers.\nRomeo and Juliet belongs to a tradition of tragic romances stretching back to antiquity. Its plot is based on an Italian tale, translated into verse as The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet by Arthur Brooke in 1562 and retold in prose in Palace of Pleasure by William Painter in 1567. Shakespeare borrowed heavily from both but, to expand the plot, developed supporting characters, particularly Mercutio and Paris. Believed to have been written between 1591 and 1595, the play was first published in a quarto version in 1597. This text was of poor quality, and later editions corrected it, bringing it more in line with Shakespeare's original.\nShakespeare's use of his poetic dramatic structure, especially effects such as switching between comedy and tragedy to heighten tension, his expansion of minor characters, and his use of sub-plots to embellish the story, has been praised as an early sign of his dramatic skill. The play ascribes different poetic forms to different characters, sometimes changing the form as the character develops. Romeo, for example, grows more adept at the sonnet over the course of the play.\nRomeo and Juliet has been adapted numerous times for stage, film, musical and opera. During the English Restoration, it was revived and heavily revised by William Davenant. David Garrick's 18th-century version also modified several scenes, removing material then considered indecent, and Georg Benda's operatic adaptation omitted much of the action and added a happy ending. Performances in the 19th century, including Charlotte Cushman's, restored the original text, and focused on greater realism. John Gielgud's 1935 version kept very close to Shakespeare's text, and used Elizabethan costumes and staging to enhance the drama. In the 20th and into the 21st century, the play has been adapted in versions as diverse as George Cukor's comparatively faithful 1936 production, Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 version, Baz Luhrmann's 1996 MTV-inspired Romeo + Juliet and the 2013 non-Shakespearian adaptation by Carlo Carlei.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Romeo_and_Juliet_%28Act_IV%2C_scene_V%29.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo_and_Juliet	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Scene_3.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Scene_4.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Romeoandjuliet1597.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Samuel_Pepys.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Scene-1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Scene_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Romeo_and_Juliet_%28Act_IV%2C_scene_V%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Romeo_and_Juliet_Act_1.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Romeo_and_Juliet_Q2_Title_Page-2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Romeo_and_juliet_brown.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Mary_Saunderson_17th_century.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/John_Gilbert%2C_Romeo_and_Juliet%2C_Act_I_%E2%80%93_Prologue%2C_from_The_Works_of_William_Shakespeare_%281864%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Northcote-JulietAwakes.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Miller-RomeoJulietAct1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Opie-JulietsDeath.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/John_Gilbert%2C_Romeo_and_Juliet%2C_Act_I_%E2%80%93_Prologue%2C_from_The_Works_of_William_Shakespeare_%281864%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Portrait_of_John_Gielgud_2_by_Carl_Van_Vechten_cropped.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Romeo-and-Juliet-toy-theatre-cut-outs.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Rigaud-RomeoJuliet.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Young_Richard_Burbage.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Smirke-JulietNurse.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Shakespeare_%28oval-cropped%29.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Arthur_Brooke_Tragicall_His.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Act_I_scene_5.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Francesco_Hayez_053.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Charlotte_and_Susan_Cushman_-_Romeo_Juliet_1846.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/Act_2_prologue.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Act_II_Scene_VI.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Act_II_Scene_III.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Johann_Heinrich_F%C3%BCssli_060.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg"]	f	cover
215	Jean-Honoré Fragonard	Jean-Honoré Fragonard (French: [ʒã onoʀe fʀaɡonɑʀ]; 5 April 1732 in Grasse – 22 August 1806 in Paris) was a French painter and printmaker whose late Rococo manner was distinguished by remarkable facility, exuberance, and hedonism. One of the most prolific artists active in the last decades of the Ancien Régime, Fragonard produced more than 550 paintings (not counting drawings and etchings), of which only five are dated. Among his most popular works are genre paintings conveying an atmosphere of intimacy and veiled eroticism.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Honor%C3%A9_Fragonard	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Fragonard_musical.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/62/PD-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/The_Progress_of_Love_-_The_Meeting_-_Fragonard_1771-72.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Fragonard_First_lesson_of_horse_riding.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Portrait_d%27homme%2C_anciennement_portrait_de_Denis_Diderot_par_Fragonard.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Jean-Honor%C3%A9_Fragonard_023.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Fragonard%2C_The_See-Saw.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Fragonard%2C_The_Reader.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Fragonard_-_Blind_man%27s_bluff_game.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/FragonardGrasse.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Portrait_d%27homme%2C_anciennement_portrait_de_Denis_Diderot_par_Fragonard.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Jean-Honor%C3%A9_Fragonard_-_The_Stolen_Kiss.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Fragonard%2C_The_Bathers.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Fragonard%2C_Inspiration.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Nuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Fragonard_-_swing.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Fragonard_-_Fran%C3%A7ois-Henri_d%27Harcourt.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Jean_Honore_Fragonard_The_Love_Letter.jpg"]	f	cover
383	Young Turks	The Young Turks (Turkish: Jön Türkler, from French: Les Jeunes Turcs, or Turkish: Genç Türkler) was a Turkish nationalist reform party in the early 20th century, favoring reformation of the absolute monarchy of the Ottoman Empire. Officially known as the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP; Turkish: İttihat ve Terakki Cemiyeti), their leaders led a rebellion against the absolute rule of Sultan Abdulhamid II in the 1908 Young Turk Revolution. With this revolution, the Young Turks helped to establish the Second Constitutional Era in 1908, and the Committee of Union and Progress, based on the ideas of the Young Turks, ruled the Ottoman Empire from 1908 until the end of World War I in November 1918.\nLike other revolutionary societies, the Young Turks had their origins in secret societies of "progressive medical university students and military cadets", namely the Young Ottomans, driven underground along with all political dissent after the Ottoman constitution of 1876 was abolished and the First Constitutional Era brought to a close by Abdulhamid II in 1878 after only two years. The Committee of Union and Progress favored a re-installation of the short-lived constitution of 1876, written by the progressive Midhat Pasha.\nIn 1913, the top leadership of the Committee of Union and Progress seized personal power in the 1913 Ottoman coup d'état. The CUP-led government was headed by Minister of the Interior and Grand Vizier, Talaat Pasha (1874–1921). Working with him were Minister of War, Enver Pasha (1881–1922), and Minister of the Navy, Djemal Pasha (1872–1922). Until German archives were opened, historians treated the Three Pashas' government as a "dictatorial triumvirate". Recently, it has been found that the party was rent by internal disagreements and loosely headed by a large number of the party's central committee. During World War I, the CUP leadership was responsible for the Armenian Genocide, which consisted of deportation and death marches into the Syrian Desert along with massacres of 1.5 million ethnic Armenian citizens of the Ottoman Empire.\nThe term "Young Turks" has come to signify progressive, revolutionary, or rebellious members of an organization, especially ones agitating for radical reform.	\N	\N	\N	http://asbarez.com/App/Asbarez/eng/2009/11/d-007.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Turks	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Young_Turksfirstcongress.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Young_Turk_Revolution_-_Decleration_-_Armenian_Greek_Muslim_Leaders.png"]	f	cover
55	Huguenot	The Huguenots (/ˈhjuːɡənɒt/ or /huːɡəˈnoʊ/; French: [yɡno], [yɡəno]) were members of the Protestant Reformed Church of France during the 16th and 17th centuries. French Protestants were inspired by the writings of John Calvin in the 1530s, and they were called Huguenots by the 1560s. By the end of the 17th century and into the 18th century, roughly 500,000 Huguenots had fled France during a series of religious persecutions. They relocated to Protestant nations, such as England, Wales, Scotland, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, the Dutch Republic, the Electorate of Brandenburg, Electorate of the Palatinate (both in the Holy Roman Empire), the Duchy of Prussia, the Channel Islands and also to Cape Colony in South Africa and several of the English colonies of North America which were willing to accept them.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenot	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Huguenot_obelisk.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Huguenot_lovers_on_St._Bartholomew%27s_Day.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/Relief_1885.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Massacre_of_the_Vaudois_of_Merindol.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ad/WalloonMonumentNYC.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Francois_Dubois_001.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Fort_caroline.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Henry_IV_en_Herculeus_terrassant_l_Hydre_de_Lerne_cad_La_ligue_Catholique_Atelier_Toussaint_Dubreuil_circa_1600.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/FrenchProtestantChurch.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/CalasChapbook.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Jean_Hasbrouck_House.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Croix_huguenote.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Calvin.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Print_entitled_Horribles_cruautes_des_Huguenot_en_France_16th_century.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Huguenot_canterbury.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/HuguenotMemorialMuseum.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Nicaea_icon.jpg"]	f	cover
59	Thomas More	Sir Thomas More (/ˈmɔr/; 7 February 1478 – 6 July 1535), known to Roman Catholics as Saint Thomas More, was an English lawyer, social philosopher, author, statesman and noted Renaissance humanist. He was an important councillor to Henry VIII and Lord Chancellor from October 1529 to 16 May 1532. More opposed the Protestant Reformation, in particular the theology of Martin Luther and William Tyndale, whose books he burned and whose followers he persecuted. More also wrote Utopia, published in 1516, about the political system of an ideal and imaginary island nation. More later opposed the King's separation from the Catholic Church and refused to accept him as Supreme Head of the Church of England because it disparaged papal authority and Henry's marriage to Catherine of Aragon. Tried for treason, More was convicted on perjured testimony and beheaded.\nPope Pius XI canonised More in 1935 as a martyr of the schism that separated the Church of England from Rome; Pope John Paul II in 2000 declared More the "heavenly Patron of Statesmen and Politicians". Since 1980, the Church of England has remembered More liturgically as a Reformation martyr. In 2002, he was placed at number 37 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Chelsea_thomas_more_statue_1.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_More	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/London_01_2013_Tower_Hill_scaffold_plaque_5214.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/London_01_2013_Tower_Hill_scaffold_5211.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/More_famB_1280x-g0.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/MEDAILLON.OF.SAINT.THOMAS.MORE.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Sir_Thomas_More_family%27s_vault_in_St_Dunstan%27s_Church_%28Canterbury%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28HM_Government%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Thomas_Aquinas_in_Stained_Glass.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Study_for_portrait_of_the_More_family%2C_by_Hans_Holbein_the_Younger.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Thomas_More_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Hans_Holbein%2C_the_Younger_-_Sir_Thomas_More_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Coat_of_arms_Holy_See.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Chelsea_thomas_more_statue_1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Gloriole_blur.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Coat_of_arms_Holy_See.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/046CupolaSPietro.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Chelsea_Old_Church_14.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/APSjfb.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Kruis_san_damiano.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/HouseOfMore.JPG"]	f	50%

Goya was court painter to the Spanish Crown; throughout the Peninsular War he remained in Madrid, where he painted the portrait of Joseph Bonaparte, pretender to the Spanish throne, and documented the war in the masterpiece of studied ambiguity known as the Desastres de la Guerra. Through his works he was both a commentator on and chronicler of his era. The subversive imaginative element in his art, as well as his bold handling of paint, provided a model for the work of artists of later generations, notably Manet, Picasso and Francis Bacon.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/La_cometa.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Goya	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Goya_Maja_naga2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Prado_-_Los_Desastres_de_la_Guerra_-_No._33_-_Que_hai_que_hacer_mas%3F.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Vicente_L%C3%B3pez_Porta%C3%B1a_-_el_pintor_Francisco_de_Goya.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Francisco_de_Goya_y_Lucientes_054.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Francisco_de_Goya_y_Lucientes_-_Witches%27_Sabbath_%28The_Great_He-Goat%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Josefa_Bayeu_Francisco_De_Goya_y_Lucientes.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Goya_MilkMaid.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Autorretrato_Goya_1815.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/El_Tres_de_Mayo%2C_by_Francisco_de_Goya%2C_from_Prado_thin_black_margin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Francisco_de_Goya_-_Retrato_de_Mart%C3%ADn_Zapater.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Courtyard_with_Lunatics_by_Goya_1794.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Museo_del_Prado_-_Goya_-_Caprichos_-_No._43_-_El_sue%C3%B1o_de_la_razon_produce_monstruos.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/La_cometa.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Goya_Maja_ubrana2.jpg"]	f	cover

23	Renaissance Man	A polymath (Greek: πολυμαθής, polymathēs, "having learned much") is a person whose expertise spans a significant number of different subject areas; such a person is known to draw on complex bodies of knowledge to solve specific problems. The term was first used in the seventeenth century but the related term, polyhistor, is an ancient term with similar meaning.\nThe term is often used to describe those great thinkers of the Renaissance and the Golden Age of Islam[citation needed], each of whom excelled at several fields in science and the arts, including such individuals as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Galileo Galilei, Paolo Sarpi, Nicolaus Copernicus, Francis Bacon, Michael Servetus, Ibn al-Haytham[citation needed], Ibn Sina[citation needed], and Omar Khayyám[citation needed]. These thinkers embodied a notion that emerged in Renaissance Italy, expressed by one of its most accomplished representatives, Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472), that "a man can do all things if he will." Embodying a basic tenet of Renaissance humanism that humans are empowered and limitless in their capacity for development, the concept led to the notion that people should embrace all knowledge and develop their capacities as fully as possible.\nThe term applies to the gifted people of the Renaissance who sought to develop their abilities in all areas of knowledge as well as in physical development, social accomplishments, and the arts, in contrast to the vast majority of people of that age who were not well educated. This term entered the lexicon during the twentieth century and has now been applied to great thinkers living before and after the Renaissance.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Man	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Hildegard_von_Bingen.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Nuvola_apps_bookcase.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Leonardo_da_Vinci_-_presumed_self-portrait_-_WGA12798.jpg"]	f	cover

85	Peace of Westphalia	The Peace of Westphalia was a series of peace treaties signed between May and October 1648 in Osnabrück and Münster. These treaties ended the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) in the Holy Roman Empire, and the Eighty Years' War (1568–1648) between Spain and the Dutch Republic, with Spain formally recognizing the independence of the Dutch Republic.\nThe Peace of Westphalia treaties involved the Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand III, of the House of Habsburg; the Kingdom of Spain; the Kingdom of France; the Swedish Empire; the Dutch Republic; the Princes of the Holy Roman Empire; and sovereigns of the free imperial cities and can be denoted by two major events.\nThe signing of the Peace of Münster between the Dutch Republic and the Kingdom of Spain on 30 January 1648, officially ratified in Münster on 15 May 1648.\nThe signing of two complementary treaties on 24 October 1648, namely:\nThe Treaty of Münster (Instrumentum Pacis Monasteriensis, IPM), concerning the Holy Roman Emperor and France and their respective allies.\nThe Treaty of Osnabrück (Instrumentum Pacis Osnabrugensis, IPO), concerning the Holy Roman Empire, the Kingdom of France, Sweden and their respective allies.\n\nThe treaties resulted from the big diplomatic congress, thereby initiating a new system of political order in central Europe, later called Westphalian sovereignty, based upon the concept of a sovereign state governed by a sovereign and establishing a prejudice in international affairs against interference in another nation's domestic business. The treaty not only signaled the end of the perennial, destructive wars that had ravaged Europe, it also represented the triumph of sovereignty over empire,of national rule over the personal writ of the Habsburgs and the establishment of the first version of international order. The treaties' regulations became integral to the constitutional law of the Holy Roman Empire, and stood as a precursor to later large international treaties and thereby the development of international law in general.\nThe treaties did not restore peace all throughout Europe, however, as France and Spain remained at war for the next eleven years, but they did create a basis for national self-determination.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/65/Waricon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/The_Ratification_of_the_Treaty_of_Munster%2C_Gerard_Ter_Borch_%281648%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Holy_Roman_Empire_1648.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Europe_1648_westphal_1884.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Europe_map_1648.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Europe_green_light.png"]	f	cover
286	John Constable	John Constable (/ˈkʌnstəbəlˌ ˈkɒn-/; 11 June 1776 – 31 March 1837) was an English Romantic painter. Born in Suffolk, he is known principally for his landscape paintings of Dedham Vale, the area surrounding his home—now known as "Constable Country"—which he invested with an intensity of affection. "I should paint my own places best", he wrote to his friend John Fisher in 1821, "painting is but another word for feeling".\nHis most famous paintings include Dedham Vale of 1802 and The Hay Wain of 1821. Although his paintings are now among the most popular and valuable in British art, Constable was never financially successful. He did not become a member of the establishment until he was elected to the Royal Academy at the age of 52. His work was embraced in France, where he sold more works than in his native England and inspired the Barbizon school.	\N	\N	\N	http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MtDdHJe91zU/T9rwp6D40AI/AAAAAAAAImE/2UlwaNm_lpM/s320/conwhi.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Constable	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/The_Opening_of_Waterloo_Bridge_seen_from_Whitehall_Stairs_John_Constable.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/John_Constable_006.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/John_Constable_-_Wivenhoe_Park%2C_Essex_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/John_Constable_-_Salisbury_Cathedral_from_the_Bishop%27s_Garden_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/John_Constable_022.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/John_Constable_008.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/ConstableSelfPortrait.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Constable_DeadhamVale.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Constable_-_Seascape_Study_with_Rain_Cloud.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/57/Constable_tomb.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/John_Constable_The_Hay_Wain.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/John_Constable_027.jpg"]	f	cover
82	Divine right of kings	The divine right of kings, or divine-right theory of kingship, is a political and religious doctrine of royal and political legitimacy. It asserts that a monarch is subject to no earthly authority, deriving the right to rule directly from the will of God. The king is thus not subject to the will of his people, the aristocracy, or any other estate of the realm, including (in the view of some, especially in Protestant countries) the Church. According to this doctrine, only God can judge an unjust king. The doctrine implies that any attempt to depose the king or to restrict his powers runs contrary to the will of God and may constitute a sacrilegious act. It is often expressed in the phrase "by the Grace of God", attached to the titles of a reigning monarch.\nThe remote origins of the theory are rooted in the medieval idea that God had bestowed earthly power on the king, just as God had given spiritual power and authority to the church, centering on the pope. The immediate author of the theory was Jean Bodin,[citation needed] who based it on the interpretation of Roman law. With the rise of nation-states and the Protestant Reformation, the theory of divine right justified the king's absolute authority in both political and spiritual matters. The theory came to the fore in England under the reign of James I of England (1603–1625, also known as James VI of Scotland 1567–1625). Louis XIV of France (1643–1715) strongly promoted the theory as well.\nThe theory of divine right was abandoned in England during the Glorious Revolution of 1688–89. The American and French Revolutions of the late eighteenth century further weakened the theory's appeal, and by the early twentieth century, it had been virtually abandoned.\nThe Scots textbooks of the divine right of kings were written in 1597-98 by James VI of Scotland before his accession to the English throne. His Basilikon Doron, a manual on the powers of a king, was written to edify his four-year-old son Henry Frederick king "acknowledgeth himself ordained for his people, having received from the god a burden of government, whereof he must be countable."	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_right_of_kings	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Heraldic_Royal_Crown_%28Common%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5e/PapalPolitics2.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Louis_XIV_habill%C3%A9_en_soleil.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/King_Charles_I_from_NPG.jpg"]	f	cover
9	Humanism	Humanism is a philosophical and ethical stance that emphasizes the value and agency of human beings, individually and collectively, and generally prefers critical thinking and evidence (rationalism, empiricism) over established doctrine or faith (fideism). The meaning of the term humanism has fluctuated, according to the successive intellectual movements which have identified with it. Generally, however, humanism refers to a perspective that affirms some notion of a "human nature" (sometimes contrasted with antihumanism).\nIn modern times, humanist movements are typically aligned with secularism and with non-theistic religions. Historically however, this was not always the case.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Sound-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Isola_di_Utopia_Moro.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/HumanismSymbol.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Quentin_Massys-_Erasmus_of_Rotterdam.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Gianfrancesco_Poggio_Bracciolini.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Humanism.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Happyman.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Salutati.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Ritratto_di_francesco_petrarca%2C_altichiero%2C_1376_circa%2C_padova.jpg"]	f	cover

95	Diego Velázquez	Diego Rodríguez de Silva y Velázquez (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈdjeɣo roˈðɾiɣeð ðe ˈsilβa i βeˈlaθkeθ]; baptized June 6, 1599 – August 6, 1660) was a Spanish painter who was the leading artist in the court of King Philip IV and one of the most important painters of the Spanish Golden Age. He was an individualistic artist of the contemporary Baroque period, important as a portrait artist. In addition to numerous renditions of scenes of historical and cultural significance, he painted scores of portraits of the Spanish royal family, other notable European figures, and commoners, culminating in the production of his masterpiece Las Meninas (1656).\nFrom the first quarter of the nineteenth century, Velázquez's artwork was a model for the realist and impressionist painters, in particular Édouard Manet. Since that time, famous modern artists, including Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dalí and Francis Bacon, have paid tribute to Velázquez by recreating several of his most famous works.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Vel%C3%A1zquez	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/VEL%C3%81ZQUEZ_-_Vieja_friendo_huevos_%28National_Galleries_of_Scotland%2C_1618._%C3%93leo_sobre_lienzo%2C_100.5_x_119.5_cm%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Retrato_del_Papa_Inocencio_X._Roma%2C_by_Diego_Vel%C3%A1zquez.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Vel%C3%A1zquez_-_Pablo_de_Valladolid_%28Museo_del_Prado%2C_1636-37%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Velazquez1632philipIV.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Diego_Vel%C3%A1zquez_Autorretrato_45_x_38_cm_-_Colecci%C3%B3n_Real_Academia_de_Bellas_Artes_de_San_Carlos_-_Museo_de_Bellas_Artes_de_Valencia.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Diego_Vel%C3%A1zquez_030.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Las_Meninas_%281656%29%2C_by_Velazquez.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Ladyfromspanishcourt.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Casa_natal_de_Velazquez.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Velazquez-The_Surrenderof_Breda.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Diego_Vel%C3%A1zquez_019.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Diego_Rodr%C3%ADguez_de_Silva_y_Vel%C3%A1zquez.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Vel%C3%A1zquez_-_El_Triunfo_de_Baco_o_Los_Borrachos_%28Museo_del_Prado%2C_1628-29%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Retrato_de_la_infanta_Margarita_%283%29%2C_by_Diego_Vel%C3%A1zquez.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Retrato_de_Juan_Pareja%2C_by_Diego_Vel%C3%A1zquez.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Velazquez_figurando.jpg"]	f	cover
33	Madrigal	A madrigal is a secular vocal music composition, usually a partsong, of the Renaissance and early Baroque eras. Traditionally, polyphonic madrigals are unaccompanied; the number of voices varies from two to eight, and most frequently from three to six. It is quite distinct from the Italian Trecento madrigal of the late 13th and 14th centuries, with which it shares only the name.\nMadrigals originated in Italy during the 1520s. Unlike many strophic forms of the time, most madrigals were through-composed. In the madrigal, the composer attempted to express the emotion contained in each line, and sometimes individual words, of a celebrated poem.\nThe madrigal originated in part from the frottola, in part from the resurgence in interest in vernacular Italian poetry, and also from the influence of the French chanson and polyphonic style of the motet as written by the Franco-Flemish composers who had naturalized in Italy during the period. A frottola generally would consist of music set to stanzas of text, while madrigals were through-composed. However, some of the same poems were used for both frottola and madrigals. The poetry of Petrarch in particular shows up in a wide variety of genres.\nIn Italy, the madrigal was the most important secular form of music of its time. The madrigal reached its formal and historical zenith by the second half of the 16th century. English and German composers, too, took up the madrigal in its heyday. After the 1630s, the madrigal began to merge with the cantata and the dialogue. With the rise of opera in the early 17th century, the aria gradually displaced the madrigal.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrigal	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Pietro_Bembo_-_Titian.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Luca_marenzio.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Britannica_Serpent.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Kynseker_Sopran.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Claudio_Monteverdi.jpg"]	f	cover
8	Petrarch	Francesco Petrarca (July 20, 1304 – July 19, 1374), commonly anglicized as Petrarch (/ˈpiːtrɑrk/, /ˈpɛtrɑrk/), was an Italian scholar and poet in Renaissance Italy, and one of the earliest humanists. Petrarch's rediscovery of Cicero's letters is often credited for initiating the 14th-century Renaissance. Petrarch is often called the "Father of Humanism". In the 16th century, Pietro Bembo created the model for the modern Italian language based on Petrarch's works, as well as those of Giovanni Boccaccio, and, to a lesser extent, Dante Alighieri. Petrarch would be later endorsed as a model for Italian style by the Accademia della Crusca. Petrarch's sonnets were admired and imitated throughout Europe during the Renaissance and became a model for lyrical poetry. He is also known for being the first to develop the concept of the "Dark Ages".	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrarch	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Petrarca_Tomb_%28Arqua%29.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/03/Flag_of_Italy.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Mont_ventoux_summit.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Thorvaldsen_Cicero.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-1985-0819-019%2C_Handschrift%2C_Francesco_Petrarca.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Books-aj.svg_aj_ashton_01.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/Francesco_Petrarca00.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Dante_Luca.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Altichiero%2C_ritratto_di_Francesco_Petrarca.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Simone_Martini_-_Frontispice_du_Virgile.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Arqu%C3%A0_Petrarca_Punto_di_vista_di_un%27aquila.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Arezzo-Santa_Maria_della_Pieve.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/35/Fates_tapestry.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Francesco_Petrarca2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Francesco_Petrarca01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg"]	f	cover

508	Ottoman Empire	The Ottoman Empire (Ottoman Turkish: دَوْلَتِ عَلِيّهٔ عُثمَانِیّه Devlet-i Aliyye-i Osmâniyye, Turkish: Osmanlı İmparatorluğu), sometimes referred to as the Turkish Empire or simply Turkey, was an empire founded by Oghuz Turks under Osman Bey in northwestern Anatolia in 1299. With the conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed II in 1453, the Ottoman state was transformed into an empire.\n\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, in particular at the height of its power under the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman Empire was one of the most powerful states in the world – a multinational, multilingual empire, controlling much of Southeast Europe, Western Asia, the Caucasus, North Africa and the Horn of Africa. At the beginning of the 17th century the empire contained 32 provinces and numerous vassal states, some of which were later absorbed into the empire, while others were granted various types of autonomy during the course of centuries.\nWith Constantinople as its capital and control of vast lands around the Mediterranean basin, the Ottoman Empire was at the centre of interactions between the Eastern and Western worlds for over six centuries. It was dissolved in the aftermath of World War I; the collapse of the empire led to the emergence of the new state of Turkey in the Ottoman Anatolian heartland, as well as the creation of modern Balkan and Middle Eastern states.	\N	\N	\N	http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xmxQrKO6jJY/UgA3r4xr8hI/AAAAAAAAAOA/px9_Bd86KGI/s1600/Ottoman_Empire_16-17th_century_.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Flag_of_Moldova.svg",

493	Joseph M. W. Turner	Joseph Mallord William Turner, RA (baptised 14 May 1775 – 19 December 1851) was a British Romantic landscape painter, water-colourist, and printmaker. Turner was considered a controversial figure in his day, but is now regarded as the artist who elevated landscape painting to an eminence rivalling history painting. Although renowned for his oil paintings, Turner is also one of the greatest masters of British watercolour landscape painting. He is commonly known as "the painter of light" and his work is regarded as a Romantic preface to Impressionism. Some of his works also are cited as examples of Abstract Art existing prior to recognition in the early twentieth century.	\N	\N	\N	http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TIuNxv5RXVk/UGCH4-iSKTI/AAAAAAAAOvw/AnQpWqC-70s/s1600/Joseph%2BMallord%2BWilliam%2BTurner%2B-%2BAlnwick%2BCastle.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._W._Turner	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/St_John%27s_Church%2C_Margate.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Wreckers_Coast_of_Northumberland_Joseph_Mallord_William_Turner.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Shipwreck_turner.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Turner%2C_J._M._W._-_The_Fighting_T%C3%A9m%C3%A9raire_tugged_to_her_last_Berth_to_be_broken.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Willem_van_de_Velde_the_Younger%2C_Ships_on_a_Stormy_Sea_%28c._1672%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Turner_selfportrait.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/Joseph_Mallord_William_Turner_-_Dutch_Boats_in_a_Gale_-_WGA23163.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/JMW_Turner_-_Modern_Rome_-_Campo_Vacino.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Joseph_Mallord_William_Turner_-_Raby_Castle%2C_the_Seat_of_the_Earl_of_Darlington_-_Walters_3741.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Joseph_Mallord_William_Turner_-_Fishermen_at_Sea_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/A_View_of_the_Archbishop%27s_Palace%2C_Lambeth.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Turner_Ovid_Banished_from_Rome.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/IvyBridge.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Chichester_Canal_%281828%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Brougham_Castle_mezzotint%2C_J._M._W._Turner.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Rain_Steam_and_Speed_the_Great_Western_Railway.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Joseph_Mallord_William_Turner_024.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg"]	f	cover
12	Masaccio	Masaccio (Italian: [maˈzattʃo]; December 21, 1401 – autumn 1428), born Tommaso di Ser Giovanni di Simone, was the first great painter of the Quattrocento period of the Italian Renaissance. According to Vasari, Masaccio was the best painter of his generation because of his skill at recreating lifelike figures and movements as well as a convincing sense of three-dimensionality. Masaccio died at twenty-six and little is known about the exact circumstances of his death.\nThe name Masaccio is a humorous version of Maso (short for Tommaso), meaning "clumsy" or "messy" Tom. The name may have been created to distinguish him from his principal collaborator, also called Maso, who came to be known as Masolino ("little/delicate Tom").\nDespite his brief career, he had a profound influence on other artists. He was one of the first to use linear perspective in his painting, employing techniques such as vanishing point in art for the first time. He also moved away from the International Gothic style and elaborate ornamentation of artists like Gentile da Fabriano to a more naturalistic mode that employed perspective and chiaroscuro for greater realism.	\N	\N	\N	http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L2hSM8T8BAY/T15_WEaCyyI/AAAAAAAAAcc/jWz4hPGmGPY/s1600/MasaccioTributeMoney.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masaccio	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Masaccio_Self_Portrait.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Masaccio_031.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Masolino_008.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Masaccio_trinity.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Filippino_Lippi_011.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Masaccio7.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Masaccio-TheExpulsionOfAdamAndEveFromEden-Restoration.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Wikinews-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/San_Giovenale_Masaccio.jpg"]	f	cover
89	Cardinal Richelieu	Armand Jean du Plessis, cardinal-duc de Richelieu et de Fronsac (French pronunciation: ​[ʁiʃəljø]; 9 September 1585 – 4 December 1642) was a French clergyman, noble and statesman.\nConsecrated as a bishop in 1608, he later entered politics, becoming a Secretary of State in 1616. Richelieu soon rose in both the Catholic Church and the French government, becoming a Cardinal in 1622, and King Louis XIII's chief minister in 1624. He remained in office until his death in 1642; he was succeeded by Cardinal Mazarin, whose career he had fostered.\nThe Cardinal de Richelieu was often known by the title of the King's "Chief Minister" or "First Minister". As a result, he is considered to be the world's first Prime Minister, in the modern sense of the term.[who?] He sought to consolidate royal power and crush domestic factions. By restraining the power of the nobility, he transformed France into a strong, centralized state. His chief foreign policy objective was to check the power of the Austro-Spanish Habsburg dynasty, and to ensure French dominance in the Thirty Years' War that engulfed Europe. Although he was a cardinal, he did not hesitate to make alliances with Protestant rulers in attempting to achieve his goals.\nRichelieu was also famous for his patronage of the arts; most notably, he founded the Académie Française, the learned society responsible for matters pertaining to the French language. Richelieu is also known by the sobriquet l'Éminence rouge ("the Red Eminence"), from the red shade of a cardinal's clerical dress and the style "eminence" as a cardinal.\nAs an advocate for Samuel de Champlain and of the retention of New France, he founded the Compagnie des Cent-Associés and saw the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye return Quebec City to French rule under Champlain, after the settlement had been captured by the Kirkes in 1629. This in part allowed the colony to eventually develop into the heartland of Francophone culture in North America.\nHe is also a leading character in The Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas and its subsequent film adaptations, portrayed as a main antagonist, and a powerful ruler, even more powerful than the King himself, though events like the Day of the Dupes show that in fact he very much depended on the King's confidence to keep this power.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Triple_Portrait_of_Cardinal_de_Richelieu_probably_1642%2C_Philippe_de_Champaigne.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_Richelieu	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Peter_Paul_Rubens_095b.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Triple_Portrait_of_Cardinal_de_Richelieu_probably_1642%2C_Philippe_de_Champaigne.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Cardinal_de_Richelieu.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Louis_XIII.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Tanche.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Richelieu_1943.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Charles_De_Gaulle_%28R91%29_underway_2009.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Cardinal_Richelieu_by_Robert_Nanteuil_1657.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Coat_of_Arms_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Coat_of_Arms_of_Cardinal_Richelieu.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Cardinal-Richelieu-On-His-Deathbed.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Portrait_of_the_cardinal_Richelieu_%281585-1642%29_of_Bernini.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Cardinal_Richelieu_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Cardinal_Mazarin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Richelieu1-Bougault.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Royal_Standard_of_the_Kingdom_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Letter_of_Richelieu_to_Claude_de_Razilly_asking_him_to_do_everyhting_in_his_power_to_relieve_Re_Island_July_1627.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Dionysos_Louvre_Ma87_n2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Richelieu_La_Rochelle_1881_Henri_Motte_1847_1922.jpg"]	f	contain
267	Alexandre Dumas	Alexandre Dumas (French: [a.lɛk.sɑ̃dʁ dy.ma], born Dumas Davy de la Pailleterie, [dy.ma da.vi də la pa.jə.tʁi]; 24 July 1802 – 5 December 1870), also known as Alexandre Dumas, père, was a French writer. His works have been translated into nearly 100 languages, and he is one of the most widely read French authors. Many of his historical novels of high adventure, including The Count of Monte Cristo, The Three Musketeers, Twenty Years After, and The Vicomte de Bragelonne: Ten Years Later were originally published as serials. His novels have been adapted since the early twentieth century for nearly 200 films. Dumas' last novel, The Knight of Sainte-Hermine, unfinished at his death, was completed by a scholar and published in 2005, becoming a bestseller. It was published in English in 2008 as The Last Cavalier.\nProlific in several genres, Dumas began his career by writing plays, which were successfully produced from the first. He also wrote numerous magazine articles and travel books; his published works totaled 100,000 pages. In the 1840s, Dumas founded the Théâtre Historique in Paris.\nDumas' father (general Thomas-Alexandre Davy de la Pailleterie) was born in Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti) to a French nobleman and an enslaved African woman. His father's aristocratic rank helped young Alexandre acquire work with Louis-Philippe, Duke of Orléans.\nIn the election of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte in 1851, Dumas fell from favor, and left France for Belgium, where he stayed for several years. Upon leaving Belgium, Dumas moved to Russia for a few years, before going to Italy. In 1861 he founded and published the newspaper, L' Indipendente, which supported the Italian unification effort. In 1864 he returned to Paris.\nThough married, in the tradition of Frenchmen of higher social class, Dumas also had numerous affairs (allegedly as many as forty). He was known to have at least four illegitimate or "natural" children, including a boy named Alexandre Dumas after him. This son became a successful novelist and playwright, and was known as Alexandre Dumas, fils (son), while the elder Dumas became conventionally known in French as Alexandre Dumas, père (father). Among his affairs, in 1866 Dumas had one with Adah Isaacs Menken, an American actress then at the height of her career and less than half his age. Twentieth-century scholars have found that Dumas fathered another three "natural" children.\nThe English playwright Watts Phillips, who knew Dumas in his later life, described him as, "the most generous, large-hearted being in the world. He also was the most delightfully amusing and egotistical creature on the face of the earth. His tongue was like a windmill – once set in motion, you never knew when he would stop, especially if the theme was himself."	\N	\N	\N	http://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/authors/1279049943p5/4785.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_Dumas	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Maison_Dumas_Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Monte-Cristo_01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Gill_-_Dumas_P%C3%A8re.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Pantheon_Grablege_Dumas_Zola_Hugo.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Nadar_-_Alexander_Dumas_p%C3%A8re_%281802-1870%29_-_Google_Art_Project_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/Alexandre_Dumas_8.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Alexandre_Dumas_7.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Alexandre_Dumas_par_Achille_Dev%C3%A9ria_%281829%29.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Alexandre_Dumas_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Alexandre_Dumas_%281762-1806%29.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Nuvola_apps_bookcase.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Alexandre_Dumas_4.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Alexandre_Dumas_1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Dumas_pere_print_.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/DUMAS_PERE.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg"]	f	55%
260	Rosetta Stone	The Rosetta Stone is a Ptolemaic age granodiorite stele inscribed with a decree issued at Memphis in 196 BC on behalf of King Ptolemy V. The decree appears in three scripts: the upper text is Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, the middle portion Demotic script, and the lowest Ancient Greek. Because it presents essentially the same text in all three scripts (with some minor differences among them), it provided the key to the modern understanding of Egyptian hieroglyphs.\nAlthough it is believed to have originally been displayed within a temple, possibly at nearby Sais, the stone was probably moved during the early Christian or medieval period and was eventually used as building material in the construction of Fort Julien near the town of Rashid (Rosetta) in the Nile Delta. It was rediscovered there in 1799 by a soldier, Pierre-François Bouchard, of the Napoleonic expedition to Egypt. As the first Ancient Egyptian bilingual text recovered in modern times, the Rosetta Stone aroused widespread public interest with its potential to decipher this hitherto untranslated ancient language. Lithographic copies and plaster casts began circulating among European museums and scholars. Meanwhile, British troops defeated the French in Egypt in 1801, and the original stone came into British possession under the Capitulation of Alexandria. Transported to London, it has been on public display at the British Museum since 1802. It is the most-visited object in the British Museum.\nStudy of the decree was already under way as the first full translation of the Greek text appeared in 1803. It was 20 years, however, before the transliteration of the Egyptian scripts was announced by Jean-François Champollion in Paris in 1822; it took longer still before scholars were able to read Ancient Egyptian inscriptions and literature confidently. Major advances in the decoding were recognition that the stone offered three versions of the same text (1799); that the demotic text used phonetic characters to spell foreign names (1802); that the hieroglyphic text did so as well, and had pervasive similarities to the demotic (Thomas Young, 1814); and that, in addition to being used for foreign names, phonetic characters were also used to spell native Egyptian words (Champollion, 1822–1824).\nEver since its rediscovery, the stone has been the focus of nationalist rivalries, including its transfer from French to British possession during the Napoleonic Wars, a long-running dispute over the relative value of Young and Champollion's contributions to the decipherment, and since 2003, demands for the stone's return to Egypt.\nTwo other fragmentary copies of the same decree were discovered later, and several similar Egyptian bilingual or trilingual inscriptions are now known, including two slightly earlier Ptolemaic decrees (the Decree of Canopus in 238 BC, and the Memphis decree of Ptolemy IV, ca. 218 BC). The Rosetta Stone is therefore no longer unique, but it was the essential key to modern understanding of Ancient Egyptian literature and civilization. The term Rosetta Stone is now used in other contexts as the name for the essential clue to a new field of knowledge.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Rosetta_Stone_International_Congress_of_Orientalists_ILN_1874.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Rosetta_Stone.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/RosettaStoneAsPartOfOriginalStele.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Rosetta_news.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Historical_cannons_in_Rosetta.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Copy_of_Rosetta_Stone.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Place_des_ecritures_Figeac.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/PepiII-DecreeOfOfficialExactionForTempleOfMin_MetropolitanMuseum.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Akerblad.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Rosetta_Stone_International_Congress_of_Orientalists_ILN_1874.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Champollion_table.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/British_Museum_from_NE_2.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/RosettaStone-LeftAndRightSides-BritishMuseum-August21-08.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Porson_13_Jan_1803.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg"]	f	cover
69	Middle English	Middle English describes dialects of English in the history of the English language between the High and Late Middle Ages, or roughly during the three centuries between the late 12th and the late 15th century.\nMiddle English developed out of Late Old English in Norman England (1066–1154) and was spoken throughout the Plantagenet era (1154–1485). The Middle English period ended about 1470, when the Chancery Standard, a form of London-based English, began to become widespread, a process aided by the introduction of the printing press to England by William Caxton in the late 1470s. By that time the variant of the Northumbrian dialect (prevalent in Northern England) spoken in southeast Scotland was developing into the Scots language. The language of England as used after 1470 and up to 1650 is known as Early Modern English.\nUnlike Old English, which tended largely to adopt Late West Saxon scribal conventions in the period immediately before the Norman conquest of England, written Middle English displays a wide variety of scribal (and presumably dialectal) forms. This diversity suggests the gradual end of the role of Wessex as a focal point and trend-setter for writers and scribes, the emergence of more distinct local scribal styles and written dialects, and a general pattern of transition of activity over the centuries that followed, as Northumbria, East Anglia, and London successively emerged as major centres of English literature, each with their own particular interests.\nMiddle English literature of the 12th and 13th centuries is comparatively rare, as written communication was usually in Anglo-Norman or in Medieval Latin. Middle English became much more important as a literary language during the 14th century, with poets such as Chaucer, Langland, John Gower, and the Pearl Poet. There was also an interest in writing in vernacular during the Lollard movement, with religious theologians and dissenters John Wycliffe and John Purvey writing for the cause. Since the printing press was not in use in England before the 1470s, no original Middle English works are available in print; Chaucer's Canterbury Tales (Middle English: Tales of Caunterbury) was first printed in 1478. No Bibles were ever printed in Middle English; Wycliffe's Bible of 1382 to 1395 was copied by scribes and are therefore manuscripts. It is popularly believed that William Shakespeare wrote in Middle English, but he actually wrote in Early Modern English.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/EME_ye.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/Incubator-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/Incubator-logo.svg"]	f	cover
495	Steam engine	A steam engine is a heat engine that performs mechanical work using steam as its working fluid.\nUsing boiling water to produce mechanical motion goes back about 2,000 years, but early devices were not practical. The Spanish inventor Jerónimo de Ayanz y Beaumont patented in 1606 the first steam engine. In 1679 Thomas Savery developed a steam pump that used steam in direct contact with the water being pumped. Savery's steam pump used condensing steam to create a vacuum and draw water into a chamber, and then applied pressurized steam to further pump the water. The first commercial true steam engine using a piston was developed by Thomas Newcomen and was used in 1712 for pumping in a mine.\nIn 1781 James Watt patented a steam engine that produced continuous rotative motion. Watt's ten-horsepower engines enabled a wide range of manufacturing machinery to be powered. The engines could be sited anywhere that water and coal or wood fuel could be obtained. By 1883, engines that could provide 10,000 hp had become feasible. Steam engines could also be applied to vehicles such as traction engines and the railway locomotives. The stationary steam engine was a key component of the Industrial Revolution, allowing factories to locate where water power was unavailable.\nSteam engines are external combustion engines, where the working fluid is separate from the combustion products. Non-combustion heat sources such as solar power, nuclear power or geothermal energy may be used. The ideal thermodynamic cycle used to analyze this process is called the Rankine cycle. In the cycle, water is heated and transforms into steam within a boiler operating at a high pressure. When expanded through pistons or turbines, mechanical work is done. The reduced-pressure steam is then condensed and pumped back into the boiler.\nIn general usage, the term steam engine can refer to either the integrated steam plants (including boilers etc.) such as railway steam locomotives and portable engines, or may refer to the piston or turbine machinery alone, as in the beam engine and stationary steam engine. Specialized devices such as steam hammers and steam pile drivers are dependent on steam supplied from a separate boiler. Reciprocating piston type steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of electric motors and internal combustion engines gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines in commercial usage, and the ascendancy of steam turbines in power generation. Considering that the great majority of worldwide electric generation is produced by turbine type steam engines, the "steam age" is continuing with energy levels far beyond those of the turn of the 19th century.	\N	\N	\N	http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Zk28cqCWClY/UC8UOCaJkII/AAAAAAAAAEk/LQhc6URKRg8/s1600/the-steam-engine.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_engine	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Steam_engine_in_action.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Rankine_cycle_layout.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Stott_Park_Bobbin_Mill_Steam_Engine.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Steam_indicator_%28Steam_and_the_Steam_Engine_-_Land_and_Marine%2C_1875%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Triple_expansion_engine_animation.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Susquehanna_steam_electric_station.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Uniflow_steam_engine.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Turbinia_At_Speed.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Watt_steam_pumping_engine.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/cc/Triple_expansion_marine_steam_engine.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Dampfkessel_f%C3%BCr_eine_Station%C3%A4rdampfmaschine_im_Textilmuseum_Bocholt.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Boulton_and_Watt_centrifugal_governor-MJ.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Indicator_diagram_steam_admission.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Grazebrook_Beam_Engine.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/52_8134_Hoentrop_2012-09-16.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Boiler_Feed_Injector_Diagram.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Aeolipile_illustration.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Dampfturbine_Laeufer01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Oscillating_cylinder.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Jacob_Leupold_Steam_engine_1720.jpg"]	f	cover
14	Diminution	In Western music and music theory, diminution (from Medieval Latin diminutio, alteration of Latin deminutio, decrease) has four distinct meanings. Diminution may be a form of embellishment in which a long note is divided into a series of shorter, usually melodic, values (also called "coloration"). Diminution may also be the compositional device where a melody, theme or motif is presented in shorter note-values than were previously used. Diminution is also the term for the proportional shortening of the value of individual note-shapes in mensural notation, either by coloration or by a sign of proportion. A minor or perfect interval that is narrowed by a chromatic semitone is a diminished interval, and the process may be referred to as diminution (this, too, was sometimes referred to as "coloration").	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminution	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Trattado_p.5_bottom.mid", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Trattado_p.5_bottom.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Octatonic_scales_on_C.mid", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Octatonic_scales_on_C.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Perfect_fifth_on_C.mid", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Trattado_p.5.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Major_second_on_C.mid", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Major_seventh_on_C.mid", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Dim_seventh_on_C.mid", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Major_third_on_C.mid", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Diminished_sixth_on_C.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Diminished_seventh_on_C.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Diminished_triad_on_C.mid", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Diminished_third_on_C.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Half-diminished_seventh_chord_on_C.mid", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Diminished_triad_on_C.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Half_diminished_scale_C.mid", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Half-diminished_seventh_chord_on_C.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Half_diminished_scale_C.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Unison_on_C.mid", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Tritone_on_C.mid", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Trattado_p.5_top.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Trattado_p.5_top.mid", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Diminished_fourth_on_C.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Diminished_fifth_on_C.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Diminished_second_on_C.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Diminished_octave_on_C.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Art_de_la_fugue_exemple04.mid", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Dim_seventh_on_C.mid", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Art_de_la_fugue_exemple04.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Diminished_seventh_chord_on_C.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Diminished_seventh_chord_on_C.mid"]	f	cover
301	Jane Austen	Jane Austen (16 December 1775 – 18 July 1817) was an English novelist whose works of romantic fiction, set among the landed gentry, earned her a place as one of the most widely read writers in English literature. Her realism, biting irony and social commentary have gained her historical importance among scholars and critics.\nAusten lived her entire life as part of a close-knit family located on the lower fringes of the English landed gentry. She was educated primarily by her father and older brothers as well as through her own reading. The steadfast support of her family was critical to her development as a professional writer. Her artistic apprenticeship lasted from her teenage years into her thirties. During this period, she experimented with various literary forms, including the epistolary novel which she then abandoned, and wrote and extensively revised three major novels and began a fourth. From 1811 until 1816, with the release of Sense and Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814) and Emma (1815), she achieved success as a published writer. She wrote two additional novels, Northanger Abbey and Persuasion, both published posthumously in 1818, and began a third, which was eventually titled Sanditon, but died before completing it.\nAusten's works critique the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century realism. Her plots, though fundamentally comic, highlight the dependence of women on marriage to secure social standing and economic security. Her works, though usually popular, were first published anonymously and brought her little personal fame and only a few positive reviews during her lifetime, but the publication in 1869 of her nephew's A Memoir of Jane Austen introduced her to a wider public, and by the 1940s she had become widely accepted in academia as a great English writer. The second half of the 20th century saw a proliferation of Austen scholarship and the emergence of a Janeite fan culture.\n\n	\N	\N	\N	http://img1.fantasticfiction.co.uk/images/3/15927.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Austen	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Pickering_-_Greatbatch_-_Jane_Austen_-_Pride_and_Prejudice_-_She_then_told_him_what_Mr._Darcy_had_voluntarily_done_for_Lydia.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Winchester_Cathedral_view_1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/William_Austen_family_tree_two_generations.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Wincath-11S7-9687.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/PrideandPrejudiceCH3detail.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/SenseAndSensibilityTitlePage.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Royal.crescent.aerial.bath.arp.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Thomas_Langlois_Lefroy.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/SteventonRectory.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Jane_Austen_%28House_in_Chawton%29_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/CassandraAustenSilhouette.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Jane_Austen_nephews_and_nieces.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Jane_Austen_1870_cropped.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/AustenTeapotCookies.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/CassandraAusten-JaneAusten%28c.1810%29_hires.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/CassandraAusten-HenryIV.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/New-Monthly-Magazine-1816-25-p66-novels-inc-Austen-Emma-detail.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Jane_Austen_signature_from_her_will.svg"]	f	cover
37	Simony	Simony (pron. [ˈsaɪ.mə.ni] or [ˈsɪ.mə.ni]) is the act of selling church offices and roles. (Sherman & Salisbury, 2011) The practice is named after Simon Magus, who is described in the Acts of the Apostles 8:9–24 as having offered two disciples of Jesus, Peter and John, payment in exchange for their empowering him to impart the power of the Holy Spirit to anyone on whom he would place his hands. The term also extends to other forms of trafficking for money in "spiritual things". Simony was also one of the important issues during the Investiture Controversy.\n	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simony	[]	f	cover
20	Bonfire of the Vanities	Bonfire of the Vanities (Italian: Falò delle vanità) refers to the burning of objects that are deemed to be occasions of sin. The most infamous one took place on 7 February 1497, when supporters of the Dominican priest Girolamo Savonarola collected and publicly burned thousands of objects like cosmetics, art, and books in Florence, Italy, on the Mardi Gras festival. Such bonfires were not invented by Savonarola, however. They were a common accompaniment to the outdoor sermons of San Bernardino di Siena in the first half of the century.\nThe focus of this destruction was nominally on objects that might tempt one to sin, including vanity items such as mirrors, cosmetics, fine dresses, playing cards, and even musical instruments. Other targets included books that were deemed to be immoral, such as works by Boccaccio, and manuscripts of secular songs, as well as artworks, including paintings and sculpture.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonfire_of_the_Vanities	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/IMG_0797_-_Perugia_-_San_Bernardino_-_Agostino_di_Duccio_-1457-61-_-_Fal%C3%B2_delle_vanit%C3%A0_-_Foto_G._Dall%27O2.jpg"]	f	cover
105	Restoration	Prince Pyotr Dmitrievich Sviatopolk-Mirskii (Russian: князь Пётр Дми́триевич Святопо́лк-Ми́рский) (August 30 [O.S. August 18] 1857, Vladikavkaz – May 29 [O.S. May 16] 1914, Saint Petersburg) was a Russian politician and police official, Minister of the Interior in 1904–1905. He was the son of the general Dmitry Ivanovitch Sviatopolk-Mirskii and father of the literary historian D. S. Mirsky.\nPyotr was born in the Vladikavkaz into a well-known and distinguished family. He was educated at Page Corps (graduated in 1874 with the first-class honours) and was appointed Page of the Chamber. In 1875 he became a cornet at Her Empress Leib-Guards Hussars.\nPyotr Dmitrievich took part in the Russo-Turkish War, 1877–78 and was decorated for his valor in the Battle of Kars. Then he studied at the General Staff Academy (graduated in 1881). In 1884 he was the acting commander of staff of 31st Infantry division, in 1887 he was the commander of staff of 3d Grenadier division. In 1895 he was appointed the Governor of Penza, and in 1897 the Governor of Yekaterinoslav.\nIn 1900 Sipiagin appointed him Assistant Minister of the Interior and Commander of the Imperial Corps of Gendarmes. After Sipiagin's assassination (1902) Sviatopolk-Mirskii resigned as Assistant Minister but was persuaded to accept the position of Governor-General of the North-Western province that included gubernias of Vilna, Kovno and Grodno (that is modern-day Lithuania and most of the Belarus). As the Governor-General, Sviatopolk-Mirskii was credited with successful liberal reforms, defusing national tensions in the provence by allowing more rights to the national minorities, stopping pogroms against the Jews.\nIn July, 1904 he succeeded to the position of Minister of the Interior after Plehve's assassination. His appointment was seen as a victory of Liberals over the Conservatives and in the Court term as a victory of the party of widow Empress Maria Fyodorovna (who supported the liberal reforms and was a patroness of Pyotr's sister Olga) over the party of Empress consort Alexandra Fyodorovna.\nConservative Ministers Witte and Sipiagin credited Sviatopolk-Mirskii with being an honorable, intelligent man of the highest moral principles, which is notable due to his attempts at liberal reform in Imperial Russia while Minister. These reforms began with permitting members of the local Zemstvos to gather to discuss broader policy issues and coordination of Zemstvo programs, something that had not been permitted in Russia regularly. The remaining reforms were embodied in a decree that called for the inclusion of elected members to the State Council, removal of the restrictions on the Old Believers, measures to strengthen legality, extend freedom of the press and religion, broaden the authority of local self-government, eliminate unnecessary restrictions on non-Russians, and do away with exceptional laws in general. Sviatopolk-Mirskii not only allowed the congress, but also participated in its work and personally delivered its decision to Tsar Nicholas II along with his own plan for constitutional reforms.\nThe Sviatopolk-Mirskii's plan included transferring more power to the State Council of Imperial Russia. The plan was much less radical than the reforms implemented by the October Manifesto 1905, but in December 1904 it was considered ultra-radical and was dismissed.\nOn January 22 [O.S. January 9] 1905 occurred the massacre of a peaceful demonstration in Saint Petersburg, known as Bloody Sunday. According to Pyotr Dmitrievich Sviatopolk-Miirskii, he never had authorised the shooting of the demonstrators, but still fulfilled his final duty to the tsar, becoming the scapegoat for the massacre. According to Miirskii's opponents, he not only did authorise the shooting but also in order to push his own political agenda actively encouraged the demonstration.\nSviatopolk-Mirskii was replaced as Minister of the Interior by Bulygin in February 1905 and retired from government service. As a retired Minister of Interior, he was expected to be appointed a member of the State Council of Imperial Russia, but it was not the case. He retired from the political life until his death on May 16, 1914.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restoration	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Pyotr_dmitrievich_svyatopolk.jpg"]	f	cover

72	Book of Common Prayer	The Book of Common Prayer is the short title of a number of related prayer books used in the Anglican Communion, as well as by the Continuing Anglican, "Anglican realignment" and other Anglican churches. The original book, published in 1549 (Church of England 1957), in the reign of Edward VI, was a product of the English Reformation following the break with Rome. Prayer books, unlike books of prayers, contain the words of structured (or liturgical) services of worship. The work of 1549 was the first prayer book to include the complete forms of service for daily and Sunday worship in English. It contained Morning Prayer, Evening Prayer, the Litany, and Holy Communion and also the occasional services in full: the orders for Baptism, Confirmation, Marriage, 'prayers to be said with the sick' and a Funeral service. It also set out in full the "propers" (that is the parts of the service which varied week by week or, at times, daily throughout the Church's Year): the collects and the epistle and gospel readings for the Sunday Communion Service. Old Testament and New Testament readings for daily prayer were specified in tabular format as were the Psalms; and canticles, mostly biblical, that were provided to be said or sung between the readings (Careless 2003, p. 26).\nThe 1549 book was soon succeeded by a more reformed revision in 1552 under the same editorial hand, that of Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury. It was used only for a few months, as after Edward VI's death in 1553, his half-sister Mary I restored Roman Catholic worship. She herself died in 1558, and in 1559 Elizabeth I reintroduced the 1552 book with a few modifications to make it acceptable to more traditionally minded worshippers, notably the inclusion of the words of administration from the 1549 Communion Service alongside those of 1552.\nIn 1604, James I ordered some further changes, the most significant of these being the addition to the Catechism of a section on the Sacraments. Following the tumultuous events leading to and including the English Civil War, another major revision was published in 1662 (Church of England 1662). That edition has remained the official prayer book of the Church of England, although in the 21st century, an alternative book called Common Worship has largely displaced the Book of Common Prayer at the main Sunday worship service of most English parish churches.\nA Book of Common Prayer with local variations is used in churches inside and outside the Anglican Communion in over 50 different countries and in over 150 different languages (Careless 2003, p. 23). In many parts of the world, other books have replaced it in regular weekly worship.\nTraditional English Lutheran, Methodist and Presbyterian prayer books have borrowed from the Book of Common Prayer and the marriage and burial rites have found their way into those of other denominations and into the English language. Like the Authorized King James Bible and the works of Shakespeare, many words and phrases from the Book of Common Prayer have entered common parlance.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/ca/Book_of_common_prayer_1662.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b8/Book_of_Common_Prayers_in_a_Church_in_Sagda.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/ca/Book_of_common_prayer_1662.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e6/Book_of_common_prayer_Scotland_1637.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/52/Book_of_common_prayer_1552.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Canterbury_Cathedral%2C_view_of_the_Western_Towers_engraved_by_J.LeKeux_after_a_picture_by_G.Cattermole%2C_1821_edited.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Book_of_common_prayer_1549.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Edward_Bouverie_Pusey.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Canterbury_Cathedral_-_Portal_Nave_Cross-spire.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/1689_Prayerbook_Collect_for_5_November.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Anglican_rose.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Anglican_rose.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b0/Book_of_Common_Prayer_Chinese-English_Diglot.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/27/Book_of_common_prayer_1559.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg"]	f	cover
38	Dispensation	Doctor of Philosophy, abbreviated as PhD, Ph.D., D.Phil., or DPhil in English-speaking countries and originally as Dr.Philos. (for the Latin philosophiae doctor or doctor philosophiae), is in many countries a postgraduate academic degree awarded by universities. The academic level known as a Doctorate of philosophy varies considerably according to the country, institution, and time period, from entry-level research degrees to higher doctorates. A person who attains a doctorate of philosophy is automatically awarded the academic title of doctor.\nIn the context of academic degrees, the term "philosophy" does not refer solely to the field of philosophy, but is used in a broader sense in accordance with its original Greek meaning, which is "love of wisdom". In most of Europe, all fields other than theology, law, and medicine were traditionally known as philosophy, and in Germany and elsewhere in Europe the basic faculty of (liberal) arts was known as the faculty of philosophy. The doctorate of philosophy as it exists today thus originated as a doctorate in the liberal arts at the Friedrich-Wilhelms Universität, the buildings of which are today used by the Humboldt University of Berlin, becoming common in large parts of the world in the 20th century.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensation	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Nuvola_apps_bookcase.svg"]	t	cover
307	Communism	Communism (from Latin communis – common, universal) is a socioeconomic system structured upon common ownership of the means of production and characterised by the absence of classes, money, markets and the state; as well as a social, political and economic ideology and movement that aims at the establishment of this social order. The movement to develop communism, in its Marxist–Leninist interpretations, significantly influenced the history of the 20th century, which saw intense rivalry between the Communist states in the Eastern bloc and the most developed capitalist states of the Western world.\nIn the Marxist conception of communism, as technological and organizational advances in the productive forces allow for a superabundance, the articles of consumption become freely accessible allowing for distribution according to need, and therefore the use of money and markets become unnecessary while class distinctions based on ownership of productive property are eliminated. Karl Marx referred to higher-phase communism as a specific stage of historical development that inevitably emerges from the development of the productive forces, allowing for social relations based on free association. Marxist theory holds that the lower-phase of communism, colloquially referred to as socialism, being the new society established after the overthrow of capitalism, is a transitional stage in human social evolution and will give rise to a fully communist society, in which remuneration and the division of labor are no longer present.\nLeninism refers to the organizational principle of the vanguard party as a revolutionary strategy both to achieve revolution and secure political power after the revolution for the working class. Marxism-Leninism is a combination of Marxist theory with Leninism, and formed the basis for all existing Communist states in the 20th century. As a result, in the Western world, the term "Communism" became associated with social movements and political regimes associated with the Marxist-Leninist Communist International, even though these regimes claimed to be "socialist" and had not yet achieved communism, and to movements which were barely communist at all.\nCouncil communists, Orthodox Marxists and non-Marxist libertarian communists and anarcho-communists oppose the ideas of a vanguard party. Anarcho-communists advocate for the establishment of full communism immediately following the abolition of capitalism. There is a very wide range of theories amongst those particular communists in regards to how to build the types of institutions that would replace the various economic engines (such as food distribution, education, and hospitals) as they exist under capitalist systems—or even whether to do so at all.[citation needed]\nIn the modern lexicon of what many Western sociologists and political commentators refer to as the "political mainstream", communism is often used as a broad term to refer to the policies of Communist states, i.e., the ones governed by Communist parties, in general, regardless of the diversity of economic models over which they may preside. Examples of this include the policies of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam where the economic system incorporates "doi moi" and the People's Republic of China (PRC) where the economic system is described as a "socialist market economy".\n\n	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Hammer_and_Sickle_Red_Star_with_Glow.png	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2a/LeTrotskyDB.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/cd/Trotsky_militant.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Mao.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Mao_Zedong_portrait.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Kropotkin2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Lenin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Lenin_1921.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Machno.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Karl_Liebknecht.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Karl_Marx_001.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Kim_Il-sung_1946.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Kropotkin1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Communism.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Enver_Hoxha_November_1984.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Engels.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/GolodomorKharkiv.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Fidel_Castro_-_MATS_Terminal_Washington_1959.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Gramsci.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Gracchus_Babeuf.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Ho_Chi_Minh_1946_and_signature.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Hammer_and_Sickle_Red_Star_with_Glow.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Josip_Broz_Tito_Biha%C4%87_1942.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/JStalin_Secretary_general_CCCP_1942.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Symbol-hammer-and-sickle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Sputnik-stamp-ussr.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Soviet_Union%2C_Lenin_%2855%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Socrates.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Rosa_Luxemburg.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Red_flag_II.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Palmiro_Togliatti_Official.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Marx_and_Engels.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Marx_Engels_Lenin.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Brezhnev_1973.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/BlackFlagSymbol.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/CheHigh.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-B0628-0015-035%2C_Nikita_S._Chruschtschow.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/1929_Deng_Xiaoping.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/AntonioNegri_SeminarioInternacionalMundo.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Anarchy-symbol.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Communist_Party_of_the_Russian_Federation_meeting_at_Manezhnaya_Square%2C_Moscow%2C_2011-12-18.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Communist-manifesto.png"]	f	cover
333	Edgar Allan Poe	Edgar Allan Poe (born Edgar Poe; January 19, 1809 – October 7, 1849) was an American author, poet, editor, and literary critic, considered part of the American Romantic Movement. Best known for his tales of mystery and the macabre, Poe was one of the earliest American practitioners of the short story, and is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre. He is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction. He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career.\nBorn in Boston, he was the second child of two actors. His father abandoned the family in 1810, and his mother died the following year. Thus orphaned, the child was taken in by John and Frances Allan, of Richmond, Virginia. Although they never formally adopted him, Poe was with them well into young adulthood. Tension developed later as John Allan and Edgar repeatedly clashed over debts, including those incurred by gambling, and the cost of secondary education for the young man. Poe attended the University of Virginia for one semester but left due to lack of money. Poe quarreled with Allan over the funds for his education and enlisted in the Army in 1827 under an assumed name. It was at this time his publishing career began, albeit humbly, with an anonymous collection of poems, Tamerlane and Other Poems (1827), credited only to "a Bostonian". With the death of Frances Allan in 1829, Poe and Allan reached a temporary rapprochement. Later failing as an officer's cadet at West Point and declaring a firm wish to be a poet and writer, Poe parted ways with John Allan.\nPoe switched his focus to prose and spent the next several years working for literary journals and periodicals, becoming known for his own style of literary criticism. His work forced him to move among several cities, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City. In Baltimore in 1835, he married Virginia Clemm, his 13-year-old cousin. In January 1845 Poe published his poem, "The Raven", to instant success. His wife died of tuberculosis two years after its publication. For years, he had been planning to produce his own journal, The Penn (later renamed The Stylus), though he died before it could be produced. On October 7, 1849, at age 40, Poe died in Baltimore; the cause of his death is unknown and has been variously attributed to alcohol, brain congestion, cholera, drugs, heart disease, rabies, suicide, tuberculosis, and other agents.\nPoe and his works influenced literature in the United States and around the world, as well as in specialized fields, such as cosmology and cryptography. Poe and his work appear throughout popular culture in literature, music, films, and television. A number of his homes are dedicated museums today. The Mystery Writers of America present an annual award known as the Edgar Award for distinguished work in the mystery genre.	\N	\N	\N	http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_IpTJVJZUm8w/TEGtxfyaDWI/AAAAAAAAAQA/6JYIYlpXJ-0/s1600/edgar_allan_poe.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Raven_Manet_D2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/PoeNHS.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Sound-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Quill_and_ink.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Vampire_Smiley.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/VirginiaPoe.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Edgar_Allan_Poe_by_Samuel_S_Osgood%2C_1845.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Edgar_Allan_Poe_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Edgar_allen_poe_recording.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Edgar_Allan_Poe_daguerreotype_crop.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/EdgarAllanPoeGrave.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Edgar_Allan_Poe_Birthplace_Boston.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Edgar_Allan_Poe_2_retouched_and_transparent_bg.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/P1020279.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/FtIndependence2.jpg"]	f	cover
310	Trade union	A trade union (British English – trades union and amalgamation are also used), labour union (Canadian English) or labor union (American English) is an organization of workers who have united together to achieve common goals such as protecting the integrity of its trade, achieving higher pay, increasing the number of employees an employer hires, and better working conditions. The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members (rank and file members) and negotiates labour contracts (collective bargaining) with employers. The most common purpose of these associations or unions is "maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment". This may include the negotiation of wages, work rules, complaint procedures, rules governing hiring, firing and promotion of workers, benefits, workplace safety and policies.\nUnions may organize a particular section of skilled workers (craft unionism), a cross-section of workers from various trades (general unionism), or attempt to organize all workers within a particular industry (industrial unionism). The agreements negotiated by a union are binding on the rank and file members and the employer and in some cases on other non-member workers. Trade unions traditionally have a constitution which details the governance of their bargaining unit and also have governance at various levels of government depending on the industry that binds them legally to their negotiations and functioning.\nOriginating in Europe, trade unions became popular in many countries during the Industrial Revolution, when the lack of skill necessary to perform most jobs shifted employment bargaining power almost completely to the employers' side, causing many workers to be mistreated and underpaid. Trade unions may be composed of individual workers, professionals, past workers, students, apprentices and/or the unemployed.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Red_rose_02.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/NUGW_May_Day_2011.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/UnisonStrikeRallyOxford20060328_KaihsuTai.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Syndicalism.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Great_Railway_Strike_1886_-_E_St_Louis.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Demonstratie_ter_verkrijging_der_achturige_werkdag_Weeknummer%2C_24-27_-_Open_Beelden_-_13260.ogv", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/London_Trades_Demonstration.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Illegal_Union_Firing_1952_-_2007.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/1912_Lawrence_Textile_Strike_1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/Striking_workers_organised_in_the_Norwegian_labour_union_UNIO.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Co-op_activism5.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Cesar_chavez2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/UnionDensity.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Midnight_at_the_glassworks2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Luddite.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/The_hand_that_will_rule_the_world.jpg"]	f	cover
25	Chiaroscuro	Chiaroscuro (English pronunciation: /kiˌɑːrəˈskjʊəroʊ/; Italian: [kjarosˈkuːro]; Italian for light-dark) in art is the use of strong contrasts between light and dark, usually bold contrasts affecting a whole composition. It is a technical term used by artists and art historians for the use of contrasts of light to achieve a sense of volume in modelling three-dimensional objects and figures. Similar effects in cinema and photography also are called chiaroscuro.\nFurther related specialized uses of the term include chiaroscuro woodcut, for coloured woodcuts printed with different blocks, each using a different coloured ink; and chiaroscuro drawing for drawings on coloured paper with drawing in a dark medium and white highlighting.\n\n	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Rembrandt_Harmenszoon_van_Rijn_-_An_Old_Man_in_Red.JPG	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiaroscuro	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Meckenem.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Rembrandt_Harmenszoon_van_Rijn_-_An_Old_Man_in_Red.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Rembrandt_st._peter_in_prision.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Kippur.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Millais_-_Self-Portrait.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Peter_Paul_Rubens_-_De_kruisoprichting.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Raffael_045_detail_.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Jean-Honor%C3%A9_Fragonard_009.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Johannes_Vermeer_-_Het_melkmeisje_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Jos%C3%A9_de_Ribera_011.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Judith_Leyster_The_Proposition.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Mary_Coriolano2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Figurenude_%2826%29_by_CN_Foundation.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Female_artistic_nude.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Geertgen_tot_Sint_Jans_002.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Fra_Angelico_005.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Gerard_van_Honthorst_002.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Georges_de_La_Tour_007.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Goya_Christ.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Gerrit_van_Honthorst_-_De_koppelaarster.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Hijab_doll_in_shadow.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Herkules_und_Ant%C3%A4us_%28Mantegna%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/80/Barry12.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Wright_of_Derby%2C_The_Orrery.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/William-Adolphe_Bouguereau_%281825-1905%29_-_Study_of_a_Seated_Veiled_Female_Figure_%2819th_Century%29.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/The_Knitting_Woman_painting_by_William-Adolphe_Bouguereau.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Study_of_Arms_and_Hands.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Study_for_the_Kneeling_Leda.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Springinklee_schmerzensmann.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Sarazyn_evening.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Sandro_Botticelli_054.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Retrato_de_Juan_Pareja%2C_by_Diego_Vel%C3%A1zquez.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Baglione.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Antoine_Watteau_-_La_Partie_carr%C3%A9e.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Caravaggio-Crucifixion_of_Peter.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Bal26151-Jan-Both.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/5049_bassenge_chiaroscuro.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Adam_Elsheimer_002.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/5316_bassenge_saturn.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/El_Greco_-_Allegory%2C_Boy_Lighting_Candle_in_Company_of_Ape_and_Fool_%28F%C3%A1bula%29.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Domenico_Beccafumi_070.jpg"]	f	cover
26	Sfumato	Sfumato /sfo͞oˈmätō/ (which may be italicized in English, or not) is one of the four canonical painting modes of the Renaissance (the other three being Cangiante, Chiaroscuro, and Unione). Sfumato comes from the Italian "sfumare", “to tone down” or “to evaporate like smoke”.\nThe most prominent practitioner of sfumato was Leonardo da Vinci, and his famous painting of the Mona Lisa exhibits the technique. Leonardo da Vinci described sfumato as "without lines or borders, in the manner of smoke or beyond the focus plane."\nApart from Leonardo, other prominent practitioners of Sfumato were Correggio, Raphael and Giorgione. Among the students and followers of Leonardo (called as Leonardeschi) who tried their hands on Sfumato after Leonardo were Bernardino Luini and Funisi.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sfumato	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/MonaLisa_sfumato.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Stylized_Mona_Lisa.svg"]	f	cover
47	Courage	Courage is the ability and willingness to confront fear, pain, danger, uncertainty, or intimidation. Physical courage is courage in the face of physical pain, hardship, death, or threat of death, while moral courage is the ability to act rightly in the face of popular opposition, shame, scandal, or discouragement.\nIn some traditions, fortitude holds approximately the same meaning as courage. In the Western tradition, notable thoughts on courage have come from philosophers such as Aristotle, Aquinas and Kierkegaard; in the Eastern tradition, some thoughts on courage were offered by the Tao Te Ching. More recently, courage has been explored by the discipline of psychology.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courage	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Socrates.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Psi2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Victoria_Cross_Medal_Ribbon_%26_Bar.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Conscience_and_law.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Plutchik-wheel.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Fortitude.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg"]	f	cover
57	William Tyndale	William Tyndale (sometimes spelled Tynsdale, Tindall, Tindill, Tyndall; c. 1494–1536) was an English scholar who became a leading figure in Protestant reform in the years leading up to his execution. He is well known for his translation of the Bible into English. He was influenced by the work of Desiderius Erasmus, who made the Greek New Testament available in Europe, and by Martin Luther. While a number of partial and incomplete translations had been made from the seventh century onward, the grass-roots spread of Wycliffe's Bible resulted in a death sentence for any unlicensed possession of Scripture in English—even though translations in all other major European languages had been accomplished and made available. Tyndale's translation was the first English Bible to draw directly from Hebrew and Greek texts, the first English one to take advantage of the printing press, and first of the new English Bibles of the Reformation. It was taken to be a direct challenge to the hegemony of both the Roman Catholic Church and English Laws to maintain church rulings. In 1530, Tyndale also wrote The Practyse of Prelates, opposing Henry VIII's divorce on the grounds that it contravened Scripture.\nTyndale had to learn Hebrew in Germany due to England's active Edict of Expulsion against the Jews. He worked in an age where Greek was available to the European scholarly community for the first time in centuries. Erasmus compiled and edited Greek Scriptures into the Textus Receptus — ironically, to improve upon the Latin Vulgate—following the Renaissance-fueling Fall of Constantinople in 1453 and the dispersion of Greek-speaking intellectuals and texts into a Europe which previously had access to none. Sharing Erasmus' translation ideals, Tyndale took the ill-regarded, unpopular and awkward Middle-English "vulgar" tongue, improved upon it using Greek and Hebrew syntaxes and idioms, and formed an Early Modern English basis that Shakespeare and others would later follow and build upon as Tyndale-inspired vernacular forms took over. When a copy of The Obedience of a Christian Man fell into the hands of Henry VIII, the king found the rationale to break the Church in England from the Roman Catholic Church in 1534.\nIn 1535, Tyndale was arrested and jailed in the castle of Vilvoorde (Filford) outside Brussels for over a year. In 1536 he was convicted of heresy and executed by strangulation, after which his body was burnt at the stake. His dying request that the King of England's eyes would be opened seemed to find its fulfillment just two years later with Henry's authorization of The Great Bible for the Church of England—which was largely Tyndale's own work. Hence, the Tyndale Bible, as it was known, continued to play a key role in spreading Reformation ideas across the English-speaking world and eventually, on the global British Empire.\nNotably, in 1611, the 54 independent scholars who created the King James Version, drew significantly from Tyndale, as well as translations that descended from his. One estimate suggests the New Testament in the King James Version is 83% Tyndale's, and the Old Testament 76%. With his translation of the Bible the first ever to be printed in English, and a model for subsequent English translations, in 2002, Tyndale was placed at number 26 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/William_Tyndale.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Tyndale	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/62/PD-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Gloriole_blur.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Foxe%27s_Book_of_Martyrs_-_Tyndale.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Tyndale_Bible_-_Gospel_of_John.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Arduinen_gedenkteken_voor_William_Tyndale%2C_Mechelsesteenweg%2C_1800_Vilvoorde.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Canterbury_cathedral.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Bust_Of_William_Tyndale.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/William_Tyndale.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg"]	f	contain
313	John Harrison	John Harrison (3 April  [O.S. 24 March] 1693– 24 March 1776) was a self-educated English carpenter and clockmaker. He invented the marine chronometer, a long-sought after device for solving the problem of establishing the East-West position or longitude of a ship at sea, thus revolutionising and extending the possibility of safe long-distance sea travel in the Age of Sail. The problem was considered so intractable that the British Parliament offered the Longitude prize of £20,000 (comparable to £2.66 million/$4.25 million US in modern currency) for the solution.\nHarrison came 39th in the BBC's 2002 public poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/H1_low_250.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harrison	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Wooden_hourglass_3.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Longitude_blue.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e3/John_Harrison_memorial_02.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Harrison%27s_Chronometer_H5.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/H4_low_250.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/John_Harrison_Uhrmacher.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/HarrisonBP.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Captainjamescookportrait.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/H1_low_250.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Grasshopper-escapement_colored.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Longcase_clock_movement.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/John_Harrison_tombstone.jpg"]	f	cover
322	Alexander II of Russia	Alexander II of Russia (Russian: Алекса́ндр II Никола́евич, Aleksandr II Nikolaevich) (29 April [O.S. 17 April] 1818 in Moscow – 13 March [O.S. 1 March] 1881 in Saint Petersburg) was the Emperor of Russia from 2 March 1855 until his assassination in 1881. He was also the King of Poland and the Grand Prince of Finland.\nAlexander was the most successful Russian reformer since Peter the Great. His most important achievement was the emancipation of serfs in 1861, for which he became known as Alexander the Liberator (Russian: Алекса́ндр Освободитель, Aleksandr Osvoboditel'). The tsar was responsible for numerous other reforms including reorganizing the judicial system, setting up elected local judges, abolishing capital punishment, promoting local self-government through the zemstvo system, imposing universal military service, ending some of the privileges of the nobility, and promoting the universities. His brutal secret police sent thousands of dissidents into exile in Siberia.\nIn foreign policy, Alexander sold Alaska to the United States in 1867, fearing the remote colony would fall into British hands if there was another war. He sought peace, and moved away from bellicose France when Napoleon III fell in 1871. In 1872 he joined with Germany and Austria in the League of the Three Emperors that stabilized the European situation. He did fight a short war with Turkey in 1877-78. He was disappointed by the results of the Congress of Berlin in 1878, but abided by that agreement. The Russian Empire expanded in Siberia and in the Caucasus, and conquered Turkestan. Faced with an uprising in Poland in 1863, he stripped that land of its separate Constitution and incorporated it directly into Russia. To counter the rise of a revolutionary and anarchistic movements, he was proposing additional parliamentary reforms when he was assassinated.	\N	\N	\N	http://russiapedia.rt.com/files/prominent-russians/the-romanov-dynasty/alexander-ii-liberator/alexander-ii-liberator_1-t.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_II_of_Russia	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Tsar_Alexander_II_1881.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Rouble_comm%C3%A9moratif_pour_le_monument_de_Nicolas_Ier_et_effigie_d%27Alexandre_II%2C_1859.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/SignatureAlexanderII.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Tsar-liberator-imagesfrombulgaria.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Tsar_Alexander_II_-4.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/62/PD-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Coat_of_Arms_of_Russian_Empire.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Chenstokhov.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Coronation_of_Tsar_Alexander_II_-2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Coat_of_arms_of_Russia_%28XV_Century%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Imperial_Coat_of_arms_of_Russia_%2817th_century%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Flag_of_Russian_Empire_for_private_use_%281914%E2%80%931917%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Lesser_Coat_of_Arms_of_Russian_Empire.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Lesser_CoA_of_the_empire_of_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Monument_of_Alexander_II_of_Russia_in_Plovdiv.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Makovsky_Alexander_II_of_Russia.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Alexander_II_as_a_boy%2C_attributed_to_George_Dawe.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Alexander_II_and_his_dog_Milord_1870_by_Sergei_Lvovich_Levitsky.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Alexanderbotkin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Alexander_II_of_Russia_photo.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Alexander_II_%28Romanov%29_monument_in_Helsinki%2C_Finland.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Alexander_II_S_L_Levitsky.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Alexander_II_1860_by_Sergei_Lvovich_Levitsky.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Cartetsar.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Attentat_mortal_Alexander_II_%281881%29.jpg"]	f	60%
1	Novelty	Novelty (derived from Latin word novus for "new") is the quality of being new, or following from that, of being striking, original or unusual. Although it may be said to have an objective dimension (e.g. a new style of art coming into being, such as abstract art or impressionism) it generally exists in the subjective perceptions of individuals.\nFrom the meaning of being unusual usage is derived the concept of the novelty dance (a type of dance that is popular for being unusual or humorous); the novelty song (a musical item that capitalizes on something new, unusual, or a current fad); the novelty show (a competition or display in which exhibits or specimens are in way some novel); and novelty architecture (a building or other structure that is interesting because it has an amusing design). It is also this sense that applies to a novelty item, a small manufactured adornment, toy or collectible. These, in turn are often used as promotional merchandise in marketing. The chess term, novelty, is used for a move in chess which has never been played before in a recorded game.\nThe term can have pejorative sense and refer to a mere innovation. However, novelty in patent law is part of the legal test to determine whether an invention is patentable. A novelty effect is the tendency for performance to initially improve when new technology is instituted.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novelty	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg"]	f	cover

He is well known for his Counter-Reformation altarpieces, portraits, landscapes, and history paintings of mythological and allegorical subjects.\nIn addition to running a large studio in Antwerp that produced paintings popular with nobility and art collectors throughout Europe, Rubens was a classically educated humanist scholar and diplomat who was knighted by both Philip IV, King of Spain, and Charles I, King of England.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Paul_Rubens	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/The_Three_Graces%2C_by_Peter_Paul_Rubens%2C_from_Prado_in_Google_Earth.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/Rubens_W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_Vasa_%28detail%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Rubens_autograph.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Rubens_vallicella.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Self-portrait_by_Peter_Paul_Rubens.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Peter_Paul_Rubens_068.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Peter_Paul_Rubens_060.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Peter_Paul_Rubens_091b.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Peter_Paul_Rubens_083.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Peter_Paul_Rubens_Massacre_of_the_Innocents.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Peter_Paul_Rubens_105.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Rubens_-_The_Consequences_of_War_05.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Retrato_ecuestre_del_duque_de_Lerma_%28Rubens%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Rubens_Venus_at_a_Mirror_c1615.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/Rubens_Self-portrait_1623.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Peter_Paul_Rubens_-_Diana_and_Callisto_-_WGA20326.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Peter_Paul_Rubens_-_Diana_Presentig_the_Catch_to_Pan_-_WGA20291.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Peter_Paul_Rubens_004.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Peter_Paul_Rubens_-_The_Judgment_of_Paris_-_WGA20312.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/0_Prom%C3%A9th%C3%A9e_supplici%C3%A9_-_Rubens_-_Snyders_-_Philadelphia_Museum_of_Art_%28W1950-3-1%29.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Nuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/Rubens_W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_Vasa_%28detail%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Peter_Paul_Rubens_037.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Peter_Paul_Rubens_019.jpg"]	f	cover
324	William I, German Emperor	William I, also known as Wilhelm I (full name: William Frederick Louis, German: Wilhelm Friedrich Ludwig, 22 March 1797 – 9 March 1888), of the House of Hohenzollern was the King of Prussia (2 January 1861 – 9 March 1888) and the first German Emperor (18 January 1871 – 9 March 1888). Under the leadership of William and his Minister President Otto von Bismarck, Prussia achieved the unification of Germany and the establishment of the German Empire. Despite his long support of Bismarck as Minister President, however, William held strong reservations about some of Bismarck's more reactionary policies, including his anti-Catholicism and tough handling of subordinates. Contrary to Bismarck, William was described as polite, gentlemanly, and while a staunch conservative, more open to certain classical liberal ideas than his grandson Wilhelm II.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_I,_German_Emperor	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Wappen_Deutsches_Reich_-_Reichswappen_%28Grosses%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fc/Wilhelm10mark.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Wappen_Deutsches_Reich_-_Reichsadler_1889.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Kaiser-wilhelm-I.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Imperial_Monogram_of_Kaiser_Wilhelm_I.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Kr%C3%B6nung_1861.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Kaiser_Wilhelm_I._.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Caricature_of_Wilhelm_I_by_Thomas_Nast.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Wernerprokla.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Imperial_Coat_of_arms_of_Germany_%281848%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Flag_of_the_German_Empire.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Wappen_Deutsches_Reich_-_K%C3%B6nigreich_Preussen_%28Grosses%29.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Kyffhaeuserdenkmal.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Wilhelm_I%2C_German_Emperor_Signature.svg"]	f	cover

299	Monroe Doctrine	The Monroe Doctrine was a US foreign policy regarding Latin American countries in the early 19th century. It stated that further efforts by European nations to colonize land or interfere with states in North or South America would be viewed as acts of aggression, requiring U.S. intervention. At the same time, the doctrine noted that the United States would neither interfere with existing European colonies nor meddle in the internal concerns of European countries. The Doctrine was issued at a time when nearly all Latin American colonies of Spain and Portugal had achieved or were at the point of gaining independence from the Portuguese and Spanish Empires; Peru consolidated its independence in 1824, and Bolivia would become independent in 1825, leaving only Cuba and Puerto Rico under Spanish rule. The United States, working in agreement with Britain, wanted to guarantee that no European power would move in.\nPresident James Monroe first stated the doctrine during his seventh annual State of the Union Address to Congress. The term "Monroe Doctrine" itself was coined in 1850. By the end of the nineteenth century, Monroe's declaration was seen as a defining moment in the foreign policy of the United States and one of its longest-standing tenets. It would be invoked by many U.S. statesmen and several U.S. presidents, including Theodore Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and many others.\nThe intent and impact of the Monroe Doctrine persisted with only minor variations for more than a century. Its primary objective was to free the newly independent colonies of Latin America from European intervention and avoid situations which could make the New World a battleground for the Old World powers, so that the United States could exert its own influence undisturbed. The doctrine asserted that the New World and the Old World were to remain distinctly separate spheres of influence, for they were composed of entirely separate and independent nations. However, the policy became deeply resented by Latin American nations for its overt interventionism and perceived imperialism.	\N	\N	\N	http://www.history.com/images/media/slideshow/james-monroe/james-monroe-rembrandt.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe_Doctrine	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/President_Theodore_Roosevelt%2C_1904.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/John_Quincy_Adams.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Great_Seal_of_the_United_States_%28obverse%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Seal_Of_The_President_Of_The_United_States_Of_America.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Great_Seal_of_the_United_States_%28obverse%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/James_Monroe_White_House_portrait_1819.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/James_Monroe_White_House_portrait_1819.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg"]	f	cover

509	Triple Alliance	The Triple Alliance was the military alliance among Germany, Austria–Hungary, and Italy, (as opposing the Triple Entente which consisted of an alliance between Britain, France and Russia), that lasted from 1882 until World War I in 1914. Each member promised mutual support in the event of an attack by any other great power, or for Germany and Italy, an attack by France alone. In a supplementary declaration, Italy specified that its undertakings could not be regarded as being directed against Great Britain. Shortly after renewing the Alliance in June 1902, Italy secretly extended a similar guarantee to France. By a particular agreement, neither Austria–Hungary nor Italy would change the status quo in the Balkans without previous consultation.\nWhen Austria–Hungary found themselves at war in August 1914 with the rival Triple Entente (Britain, France, and the latter's ally, Russia), Italy pledged to support the Central Powers: Germany, Austria-Hungary, and later the Ottoman Empire (Turkey). However, because Germany and Austria–Hungary had taken the offensive while the Triple Alliance was supposed to have been a defensive alliance, Italy did not enter into the war. Later on, Italy entered the conflict on the side of the Entente against Austria–Hungary in May 1915 and Germany in August 1916. Carol I of Romania through his Prime Minister Ion I. C. Brătianu had also secretly pledged to support the Triple Alliance but remained neutral since Austria-Hungary started the war.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Triple_Alliance.png	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Alliance_(1882)	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Triple_Alliance.png"]	f	cover
144	Johann Sebastian Bach	Johann Sebastian Bach (31 March [O.S. 21 March] 1685 – 28 July 1750) was a German composer and musician of the Baroque period. He enriched established German styles through his skill in counterpoint, harmonic and motivic organisation, and the adaptation of rhythms, forms, and textures from abroad, particularly from Italy and France. Bach's compositions include the Brandenburg concertos, the Mass in B minor, The Well-Tempered Clavier, two Passions, keyboard works, and more than 300 cantatas, of which nearly 100 cantatas have been lost to posterity. His music is revered for its intellectual depth, technical command, and artistic beauty.\nBach was born in Eisenach, Saxe-Eisenach, into a great musical family; his father, Johann Ambrosius Bach, was the director of the town musicians, and all of his uncles were professional musicians. His father probably taught him to play violin and harpsichord, and his brother, Johann Christoph Bach, taught him the clavichord and exposed him to much contemporary music. Apparently at his own initiative, Bach attended St Michael's School in Lüneburg for two years. After graduating, he held several musical posts across Germany: he served as Kapellmeister (director of music) to Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen, Cantor of the Thomasschule in Leipzig, and Royal Court Composer to August III. Bach's health and vision declined in 1749, and he died on 28 July 1750. Modern historians believe that his death was caused by a combination of stroke and pneumonia.\nBach's abilities as an organist were highly respected throughout Europe during his lifetime, although he was not widely recognised as a great composer until a revival of interest and performances of his music in the first half of the nineteenth century. He is now generally regarded as one of the main composers of the Baroque period, and as one of the greatest composers of all time.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Young_Bach2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Zimmermannsches_Caffeehaus.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Statue_of_J.S._Bach_in_Leipzig.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/Toccata_et_Fugue_BWV565.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/90/EinFesteBurg.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/HPIM4669.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/HL_Kirche_-_Marienkirche.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Johann_Ambrosius_Bach.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/JSBWohnorte.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Johann_Sebastian_Bach_signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Johann_Sebastian_Bach.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Office-book.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Leipzig_Nikolaikirche_um_1850.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/St._Thomas_Church%2C_Leipzig.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9a/914u_Statue_of_Johann_Sebastian_Bach%2C_Eisenach%2C_GER%2C_22_S.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Bachkirche_Arnstadt.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Bach_Seal.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/CU3title.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Bachsiegel.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/BWV1001-cropped.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Bach_C_Major_Prelude_Werckmeister.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Bach_-_cantata_140._1._chorus.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Goldberg_Variations_01_Aria.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Gnome-mime-audio-openclipart.svg"]	f	cover
5	Creativity	Creativity is a phenomenon whereby something new and valuable is created (such as an idea, a joke, an artistic or literary work, a painting or musical composition, a solution, an invention etc.). The ideas and concepts so conceived can then manifest themselves in any number of ways, but most often, they become something we can see, hear, smell, touch, or taste. The range of scholarly interest in creativity includes a multitude of definitions and approaches involving several disciplines; psychology, cognitive science, education, philosophy (particularly philosophy of science), technology, theology, sociology, linguistics, business studies, songwriting and economics, taking in the relationship between creativity and general intelligence, mental and neurological processes associated with creativity, the relationships between personality type and creative ability and between creativity and mental health, the potential for fostering creativity through education and training, especially as augmented by technology, and the application of creative resources to improve the effectiveness of learning and teaching processes.\n\n	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Plato-raphael.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Nicolas_P._Rougier%27s_rendering_of_the_human_brain.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/NewtonsPrincipia.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Training_meeting_in_a_ecodesign_stainless_steel_company_in_brazil.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Plato-raphael.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/3_Basic_elements_of_Creativity.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Eletrice_wire_reel_reused_in_like_a_furniture_ecodesign.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Nicolas_P._Rougier%27s_rendering_of_the_human_brain.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/HenryMoore_RecliningFigure_1951.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg"]	f	cover
337	Emily Dickinson	Emily Elizabeth Dickinson (December 10, 1830 – May 15, 1886) was an American poet. Born in Amherst, Massachusetts, to a successful family with strong community ties, she lived a mostly introverted and reclusive life. After she studied at the Amherst Academy for seven years in her youth, she spent a short time at Mount Holyoke Female Seminary before returning to her family's house in Amherst. Thought of as an eccentric by the locals, she became known for her penchant for white clothing and her reluctance to greet guests or, later in life, even leave her room. Most of her friendships were therefore carried out by correspondence.\nWhile Dickinson was a prolific private poet, fewer than a dozen of her nearly eighteen hundred poems were published during her lifetime. The work that was published during her lifetime was usually altered significantly by the publishers to fit the conventional poetic rules of the time. Dickinson's poems are unique for the era in which she wrote; they contain short lines, typically lack titles, and often use slant rhyme as well as unconventional capitalization and punctuation. Many of her poems deal with themes of death and immortality, two recurring topics in letters to her friends.\nAlthough most of her acquaintances were probably aware of Dickinson's writing, it was not until after her death in 1886—when Lavinia, Dickinson's younger sister, discovered her cache of poems—that the breadth of Dickinson's work became apparent. Her first collection of poetry was published in 1890 by personal acquaintances Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Mabel Loomis Todd, both of whom heavily edited the content. A complete and mostly unaltered collection of her poetry became available for the first time in 1955 when The Poems of Emily Dickinson was published by scholar Thomas H. Johnson. Despite some unfavorable reviews and some skepticism during the late 19th and early 20th century as to Dickinson's literary prowess, she is now almost universally considered to be one of the most important American poets.	\N	\N	\N	http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aXzhbpAGVSA/T_LaDuC1PYI/AAAAAAAACvs/EPqgtrQoZxM/s1600/emily-dickinson-001.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Dickinson	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Emilyrepublican.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f0/Dickinson_children_painting.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Thomas_Wentworth_Higginson.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Emily_Dickinson_Homestead%2C_Amherst%2C_Massachusetts_%28from_left%29.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/Emily_Dickinson_%22Wild_nights%22_manuscript.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Emily_Dickinson_daguerreotype.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Emily_Dickinson_Poems.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/DickinsonHomestead_oct2004.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Quill_and_ink.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/EmilyDickinsonGrave-color.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Dickinson_and_Turner_1859_%28cleaned%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Emily_Dickinson%C2%B4s_%281830-1886%29_manuscript_of_%22A_route_of_evanescence%22_%281880%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Emily_Dickinson_daguerreotype_%28Restored%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg"]	f	cover
150	Modern World	Modern history, also referred to as the modern period or the modern era, is the historiographical approach to the timeframe after the post-classical era (known as the Middle Ages). Modern history can be further broken down into the early modern period and the late modern period after the French Revolution and the Industrial Revolution. Contemporary history is the span of historic events that are immediately relevant to the present time. The modern era began approximately in the 16th century.	\N	\N	\N	http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L6Jw1UJ23p0/TIZyBsdujWI/AAAAAAAAA8Y/zWwdIfFE0KM/s1600/Modern%2BWorld%2BMap.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_World	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Waldseemuller_map_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Hubble_ultra_deep_field_high_rez_edit1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/World_head_of_states_in_1889.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Xinhai_Revolution_in_Shanghai.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Spanish_Empire_-_1824.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Teslathinker.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Westward_the_Course_of_Empire.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/World_War_1.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Flag_of_Italy_%281861-1946%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Flag_of_German_Reich_%281935%E2%80%931945%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Hisparevol.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Flag_of_the_Soviet_Union.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/NATO_vs_Warsaw_%281949-1990%29.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Maquina_vapor_Watt_ETSIIM.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Naval_Jack_of_the_Republic_of_China.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Naval_Ensign_of_Japan.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Sino-german_cooperation.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/North_America_1797_-_U.S._Bureau_of_the_Census%2C_1909.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Declaration_independence.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Colonisation_1800.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Cold_War_Map_1980.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/EUROPE_1929-1938_POLITICAL_MAP.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Communist-manifesto.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Americas_independence_map.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/British_Empire_1897.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/BismarckundNapoleonIII.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Flag_of_German_Reich_%281935%E2%80%931945%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Europe_1988.png"]	f	cover
339	Brigham Young	Brigham Young (/ˈbrɪɡəm/; June 1, 1801 – August 29, 1877) was an American leader in the Latter Day Saint movement and a settler of the Western United States. He was the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1847 until his death in 1877. He founded Salt Lake City and he served as the first governor of the Utah Territory. Young also led the foundings of the precursors to the University of Utah and Brigham Young University.\nYoung had a variety of nicknames, among the most popular being "American Moses" (alternatively, the "Modern Moses" or the "Mormon Moses"), because, like the biblical figure, Young led his followers, the Mormon pioneers, in an exodus through a desert, to what they saw as a promised land. Young was dubbed by his followers the "Lion of the Lord" for his bold personality, and was also commonly called "Brother Brigham" by Latter-day Saints. Young was a polygamist and was involved in controversies regarding black people and the Priesthood, the Utah War, and the Mountain Meadows massacre.	\N	\N	\N	http://cdn1.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/images/brigham-young-1.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigham_Young	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/USVA_headstone_emb-11.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/62/PD-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7e/Brigham_Young_statue_at_BYU.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/This_Is_The_Place_Heritage_Park.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c2/Brigham_Young_and_company_1870.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Brigham_Young_by_Charles_William_Carter.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Brigham_Young_and_his_brothers.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/In_memoriam_brigham_young_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Christus_statue_temple_square_salt_lake_city.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/BrighamYoungGrave.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Brigham_Young_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Brigham_Young_Monument.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Young.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Seal_of_the_Governor_of_Utah.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Polygamist_Family_1888.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg"]	f	cover
457	World War II	World War II (WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war. It is generally considered to have lasted from 1939 to 1945, although some conflicts in Asia that are commonly viewed as becoming part of the world war had begun earlier than 1939. It involved the vast majority of the world's nations—including all of the great powers—eventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people, from more than 30 different countries. In a state of "total war", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust, the Three Alls Policy, the strategic bombing of enemy industrial and/or population centers, and the first use of nuclear weapons in combat, it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.\nThe Empire of Japan aimed to dominate East Asia and was already at war with the Republic of China in 1937, but the world war is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany formed the Axis alliance with Italy, conquering or subduing much of continental Europe. Following the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories between themselves their European neighbours, including Poland, Finland and the Baltic states. The United Kingdom and the other members of the British Commonwealth were the only major Allied forces continuing the fight against the Axis, with battles taking place in North and East Africa as well as the long-running Battle of the Atlantic. In June 1941, the European Axis powers launched an invasion of the Soviet Union, giving a start to the largest land theatre of war in history, which tied down the major part of the Axis' military forces for the rest of the war. In December 1941, Japan joined the Axis, attacked the United States and European territories in the Pacific Ocean, and quickly conquered much of the Western Pacific.\nThe Axis advance was stopped in 1942, when Japan lost a critical battle at Midway, near Hawaii, and Germany was defeated in North Africa and then decisively, at Stalingrad in Russia. In 1943, with a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front, the Allied invasion of Italy which brought about that nation's surrender, and American victories in the Pacific, the Axis lost the initiative and undertook strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded France, while the Soviet Union regained all of its territorial losses and invaded Germany and its allies. During 1944 and 1945 the Japanese began suffering major reverses in mainland Asia in Burma and South Central China whilst the United States defeated the Japanese Navy and captured key Western Pacific islands.\nThe war in Europe ended with an invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union culminating in the capture of Berlin by Soviet and Polish troops and the subsequent German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. Following the Potsdam Declaration by the Allies on 26 July 1945, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 August and 9 August respectively. With an invasion of the Japanese archipelago (known as Operation Downfall) imminent, and the Soviet Union's declaration of war on Japan with the invasion of Manchuria, Japan surrendered, 15 August 1945. Thus ended the war in Asia, cementing the total victory of the Allies over the Axis.\nWorld War II altered the political alignment and social structure of the world. The United Nations (UN) was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts. The great powers that were the victors of the war—the United States, the Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom, and France—became the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the Cold War, which lasted for the next 46 years. Meanwhile, the influence of European great powers started to decline, while the decolonisation of Asia and Africa began. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery. Political integration, especially in Europe, emerged as an effort to stabilise postwar relations and cooperate more effectively in the Cold War.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Heinkel_He_111_during_the_Battle_of_Britain.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg",

347	Scopes Trial	The Scopes Trial, formally known as The State of Tennessee v. John Thomas Scopes and commonly referred to as the Scopes Monkey Trial, was a famous American legal case in 1925 in which a high school teacher, John Scopes, was accused of violating Tennessee's Butler Act, which made it unlawful to teach human evolution in any state-funded school. The trial was deliberately staged in order to attract publicity to the small town of Dayton, Tennessee, where it was held. Scopes was unsure whether he had ever actually taught evolution, but he purposely incriminated himself so that the case could have a defendant.\nScopes was found guilty and fined $100, but the verdict was overturned on a technicality. The trial served its purpose of drawing intense national publicity, as national reporters flocked to Dayton to cover the big-name lawyers who had agreed to represent each side. William Jennings Bryan, three-time presidential candidate, argued for the prosecution, while Clarence Darrow, the famed defense attorney, spoke for Scopes. The trial publicized the Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy, which set Modernists, who said evolution was not inconsistent with religion, against Fundamentalists, who said the word of God as revealed in the Bible took priority over all human knowledge. The case was thus seen as both a theological contest and a trial on whether modern science regarding the creation-evolution controversy should be taught in schools.	\N	\N	\N	http://img.timeinc.net/time/daily/2009/0902/360_scopes_trial_0210.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopes_Trial	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/John_t_scopes.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/54/Scopes_trial.jpg"]	f	70%
342	Benjamin Franklin	Benjamin Franklin (January 17, 1706 [O.S. January 6, 1705] –  April 17, 1790) was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States and in many ways was "the First American". A world-famous polymath, Franklin was a leading author, printer, political theorist, politician, postmaster, scientist, inventor, civic activist, statesman, and diplomat. As a scientist, he was a major figure in the American Enlightenment and the history of physics for his discoveries and theories regarding electricity. As an inventor, he is known for the lightning rod, bifocals, and the Franklin stove, among other inventions. He facilitated many civic organizations, including Philadelphia's fire department and a university.\nFranklin earned the title of "The First American" for his early and indefatigable campaigning for colonial unity; as an author and spokesman in London for several colonies, then as the first United States Ambassador to France, he exemplified the emerging American nation. Franklin was foundational in defining the American ethos as a marriage of the practical values of thrift, hard work, education, community spirit, self-governing institutions, and opposition to authoritarianism both political and religious, with the scientific and tolerant values of the Enlightenment. In the words of historian Henry Steele Commager, "In a Franklin could be merged the virtues of Puritanism without its defects, the illumination of the Enlightenment without its heat." To Walter Isaacson, this makes Franklin "the most accomplished American of his age and the most influential in inventing the type of society America would become."\nFranklin, always proud of his working class roots, became a successful newspaper editor and printer in Philadelphia, the leading city in the colonies. With two partners he published the Pennsylvania Chronicle, a newspaper that was known for its revolutionary sentiments and criticisms of the British policies. He became wealthy publishing Poor Richard's Almanack and The Pennsylvania Gazette.\nHe played a major role in establishing the University of Pennsylvania and was elected the first president of the American Philosophical Society. Franklin became a national hero in America when as agent for several colonies he spearheaded the effort to have Parliament in London repeal the unpopular Stamp Act. An accomplished diplomat, he was widely admired among the French as American minister to Paris and was a major figure in the development of positive Franco-American relations. His efforts to secure support for the American Revolution by shipments of crucial munitions proved vital for the American war effort.\nFor many years he was the British postmaster for the colonies, which enabled him to set up the first national communications network. He was active in community affairs, colonial and state politics, as well as national and international affairs. From 1785 to 1788, he served as governor of Pennsylvania. Toward the end of his life, he freed his own slaves and became one of the most prominent abolitionists.\nHis colorful life and legacy of scientific and political achievement, and status as one of America's most influential Founding Fathers, have seen Franklin honored on coinage and the $100 bill; warships; the names of many towns, counties, educational institutions, namesakes, and companies; and more than two centuries after his death, countless cultural references.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/BenFranklinDuplessis.jpg/220px-BenFranklinDuplessis.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg",

357	Nihilism	Nihilism (/ˈnaɪ.ɨlɪzəm/ or /ˈniː.ɨlɪzəm/; from the Latin nihil, nothing) is a philosophical doctrine that suggests the negation of one or more putatively meaningful aspects of life. Most commonly, nihilism is presented in the form of existential nihilism, which argues that life is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value. Moral nihilists assert that morality does not inherently exist, and that any established moral values are abstractly contrived. Nihilism can also take epistemological or ontological/metaphysical forms, meaning respectively that, in some aspect, knowledge is not possible, or that reality does not actually exist.\nThe term is sometimes used in association with anomie to explain the general mood of despair at a perceived pointlessness of existence that one may develop upon realising there are no necessary norms, rules, or laws. Movements such as Futurism and deconstruction, among others, have been identified by commentators as "nihilistic" at various times in various contexts.\nNihilism is also a characteristic that has been ascribed to time periods: for example, Jean Baudrillard and others have called postmodernity a nihilistic epoch, and some Christian theologians and figures of religious authority have asserted that postmodernity and many aspects of modernity represent a rejection of theism, and that such rejection of their theistic doctrine entails nihilism.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Socrates.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Psi2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/WLANL_-_Marjolein_Benard_-_Little_thought_No._2%2C_Qiangli_Liang_%282005%29_detail.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Conscience_and_law.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/People_icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/P_religion_world.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg"]	f	cover
349	Albert Einstein	Albert Einstein (/ˈælbərt ˈaɪnstaɪn/; German: [ˈalbɐt ˈaɪnʃtaɪn] ( ); 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist. He developed the general theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). While best known for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2 (which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation"), he received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect". The latter was pivotal in establishing quantum theory.\nNear the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. This led to the development of his special theory of relativity. He realized, however, that the principle of relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields, and with his subsequent theory of gravitation in 1916, he published a paper on the general theory of relativity. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light. In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to model the large-scale structure of the universe.\nHe was visiting the United States when Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933 and did not go back to Germany, where he had been a professor at the Berlin Academy of Sciences. He settled in the U.S., becoming an American citizen in 1940. On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential development of "extremely powerful bombs of a new type" and recommending that the U.S. begin similar research. This eventually led to what would become the Manhattan Project. Einstein supported defending the Allied forces, but largely denounced the idea of using the newly discovered nuclear fission as a weapon. Later, with the British philosopher Bertrand Russell, Einstein signed the Russell–Einstein Manifesto, which highlighted the danger of nuclear weapons. Einstein was affiliated with the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, until his death in 1955.\nEinstein published more than 300 scientific papers along with over 150 non-scientific works. His great intellectual achievements and originality have made the word "Einstein" synonymous with genius.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Albert_Einstein_Head.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Stylised_Lithium_Atom.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Office-book.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Photoelectric_effect.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Rabindranath_with_Einstein.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Einsteinwiezmann.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/NYT_May_4%2C_1935.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Niels_Bohr_Albert_Einstein_by_Ehrenfest.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Nuvola_apps_kalzium.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ed/Nobel_Prize.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Solvay_conference_1927.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Albert_Einstein_violin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Albert_Einstein_signature_1934.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Death_headline.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Citizen-Einstein.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Einstein-formal_portrait-35.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Einstein-cartoon1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Einstein_1921_by_F_Schmutzer.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Einstein-with-habicht-and-solovine.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Einstein_patentoffice.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Einstein_in_NY_1921.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Wikinews-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Albert_Einstein_as_a_child.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Albert_Einstein_Head.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Albert_Einstein_german.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Albert_Einstein_at_the_age_of_three_%281882%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/1919_eclipse_positive.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Albert_Einstein_%28Nobel%29.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Albert_Einstein%27s_exam_of_maturity_grades_%28color2%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Albert_Einstein_photo_1921.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Albert_Einstein_photo_1920.jpg"]	f	cover
165	Scientific method	For observational studies see observational study\n\nThe scientific method is a body of techniques for investigating phenomena, acquiring new knowledge, or correcting and integrating previous knowledge. To be termed scientific, a method of inquiry must be based on empirical and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning. The Oxford English Dictionary defines the scientific method as: "a method or procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses."\nThe chief characteristic which distinguishes the scientific method from other methods of acquiring knowledge is that scientists seek to let reality speak for itself,[discuss] supporting a theory when a theory's predictions are confirmed and challenging a theory when its predictions prove false. Although procedures vary from one field of inquiry to another, identifiable features distinguish scientific inquiry from other methods of obtaining knowledge. Scientific researchers propose hypotheses as explanations of phenomena and design experimental studies to test these hypotheses via predictions which can be derived from them. These steps must be repeatable to guard against mistake or confusion in any particular experimenter. Theories that encompass wider domains of inquiry may bind many independently derived hypotheses together in a coherent, supportive structure. Theories, in turn, may help form new hypotheses or place groups of hypotheses into context.\nScientific inquiry is generally intended to be as objective as possible in order to reduce biased interpretations of results. Another basic expectation is to document, archive, and share all data and methodology so they are available for careful scrutiny by other scientists, giving them the opportunity to verify the results by attempting to reproduce them. This practice, called full disclosure, also allows statistical measures of the reliability of the data to be established (when data is sampled or compared to chance).	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/The_Horse_in_Motion.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Roger_Bacon.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Jean_Louis_Th%C3%A9odore_G%C3%A9ricault_001.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Gravitational_lens-full.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Johannes_Kepler_1610.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Aristotle_Altemps_Inv8575.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/DNA_icon_%2825x25%29.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Pietro_Longhi_021.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Perihelion_precession.jpg"]	f	cover
51	Huldrych Zwingli	Huldrych (or Ulrich/Ulricht) Zwingli (1 January 1484 – 11 October 1531) was a leader of the Reformation in Switzerland. Born during a time of emerging Swiss patriotism and increasing criticism of the Swiss mercenary system, he attended the University of Vienna and the University of Basel, a scholarly centre of humanism. He continued his studies while he served as a pastor in Glarus and later in Einsiedeln, where he was influenced by the writings of Erasmus.\nIn 1518, Zwingli became the pastor of the Grossmünster in Zurich where he began to preach ideas on reforming the Catholic Church. In his first public controversy in 1522, he attacked the custom of fasting during Lent. In his publications, he noted corruption in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, promoted clerical marriage, and attacked the use of images in places of worship. In 1525, Zwingli introduced a new communion liturgy to replace the Mass. Zwingli also clashed with the Anabaptists, which resulted in their persecution.\nThe Reformation spread to other parts of the Swiss Confederation, but several cantons resisted, preferring to remain Catholic. Zwingli formed an alliance of Reformed cantons which divided the Confederation along religious lines. In 1529, a war between the two sides was averted at the last moment. Meanwhile, Zwingli's ideas came to the attention of Martin Luther and other reformers. They met at the Marburg Colloquy and although they agreed on many points of doctrine, they could not reach an accord on the doctrine of the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist. In 1531 Zwingli's alliance applied an unsuccessful food blockade on the Catholic cantons. The cantons responded with an attack at a moment when Zurich was ill prepared. Zwingli was killed in battle at the age of 47. His legacy lives on in the confessions, liturgy, and church orders of the Reformed churches of today.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Ulrich-Zwingli-1.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huldrych_Zwingli	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Ulrich_Zwingli.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Ulrich-Zwingli-1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Ulrich_Zwingli_by_Asper.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Marburger-Religionsgespr%C3%A4ch.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Historische_Karte_CH_1515.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Prozessionsachse_murerplan.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Nicaea_icon.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Calvin.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Ulrich_Zwingli_Denkmal_-_Wasserkirche_-_Limmatquai_2011-08-10_11-47-50.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Geburtshaus_von_Huldrych_Zwingli.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Ermordung_Zwingli_Jauslin.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Zue_Grossmuenster_06.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Switzerland_Z%C3%BCrich_Grossm%C3%BCnster_Zwingli_M%C3%BCnch_1935.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Schlacht_bei_Kappel.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg"]	f	cover
52	Anabaptists	Anabaptists (from Neo-Latin anabaptista, from the Greek ἀναβαπτισμός: ἀνά- "over again" and βαπτισμός "baptism") are Christians of the Radical Reformation of 16th century Europe. Although some consider the Anabaptist movement to be an offshoot of Protestantism, others see it as a distinct movement.[page needed]  The Amish, Hutterites, and Mennonites are direct descendants of the movement. Brethren, Bruderhof, and the Apostolic Christian Church are later developments in Anabaptist groups.\nThe name Anabaptist is derived from the Greek term anabaptista, or "one who baptizes over again." This name was given them by their enemies in reference to the practice of "re-baptizing" converts who "already had been baptized" as infants. Anabaptists required that baptismal candidates be able to make their own confessions of faith and so rejected baptism of infants. The early members of this movement did not accept the name "Anabaptist", claiming that since infant baptism was unscriptural and null and void, the baptizing of believers was not a "re-baptism" but in fact the first baptism for them. Balthasar Hübmaier wrote:\n\nI have never taught Anabaptism. ...But the right baptism of Christ, which is preceded by teaching and oral confession of faith, I teach, and say that infant baptism is a robbery of the right baptism of Christ...\n\nAs a result of their views on the nature of baptism and other issues, Anabaptists were heavily persecuted during the 16th century and into the 17th by both Magisterial Protestants and Roman Catholics.\nWhile most Anabaptists adhered to a literal interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount which precluded taking oaths, participating in military actions, and participating in civil government, some who practiced re-baptism felt otherwise. They were thus technically Anabaptists, even though conservative Amish, Mennonites, and Hutterites and some historians tend to consider them as outside of true Anabaptism. Conrad Grebel wrote in a letter to Thomas Müntzer in 1524:\n\nTrue Christian believers are sheep among wolves, sheep for the slaughter... Neither do they use worldly sword or war, since all killing has ceased with them...	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabaptists	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/StJohnsAshfield_StainedGlass_GoodShepherd_Portrait.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Spread_of_the_Anabaptists_1525-1550.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Witch-scene4.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/95Thesen.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/P_christianity.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/Dirk.willems.rescue.ncs.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Z%C3%BCrich_-_Schipfe_IMG_1969.JPG"]	f	cover
164	Idola theatri	Idola theatri (singular Idolum theatri) is a type of tendency towards logical fallacy or error, normally translated as "Idols of the Theatre." The Latin was coined by Sir Francis Bacon in his Novum Organum—one of the earliest treatises arguing the case for the logic and method of modern science. Bacon described them as "Idols which have immigrated into men's minds from the various dogmas of philosophies, and also from wrong laws of demonstration." He named them Idols of the Theater "because in my judgment all the received systems are but so many stage plays, representing worlds of their own creation after an unreal and scenic fashion."\nThe term is one of four such "idols," that represent "idols and false notions" that are "in possession of the human understanding, and have taken deep root therein, not only so beset men's minds that truth can hardly find entrance, but even after entrance is obtained, they will again in the very instauration of the sciences meet and trouble us, unless men being forewarned of the danger fortify themselves as far as may be against their assaults". Of these, the Idola theatri is the most avoidable, being caused by particular historical situations, such as when there is a lot of interest in religion, and no strong monarch to repress such discussion.\nBesides idola theatri, there are also idola tribus (Idols of the Tribe, stemming from human nature itself), idola specus, (Idols of the cave, stemming from a person's particular tendencies), and idola fori (Idols of the Market Place, coming from the influence of philosophers and systems of thought).	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idola_theatri	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg"]	f	cover
407	Salvador Dalí	Salvador Domingo Felipe Jacinto Dalí i Domènech, 1st Marqués de Dalí de Pubol (May 11, 1904 – January 23, 1989), known as Salvador Dalí (Catalan pronunciation: [səɫβəˈðo ðəˈɫi]), was a prominent Spanish Catalan surrealist painter born in Figueres, Spain.\nDalí was a skilled draftsman, best known for the striking and bizarre images in his surrealist work. His painterly skills are often attributed to the influence of Renaissance masters. His best-known work, The Persistence of Memory, was completed in August 1931. Dalí's expansive artistic repertoire included film, sculpture, and photography, in collaboration with a range of artists in a variety of media.\nDalí attributed his "love of everything that is gilded and excessive, my passion for luxury and my love of oriental clothes" to an "Arab lineage", claiming that his ancestors were descended from the Moors.\nDalí was highly imaginative, and also enjoyed indulging in unusual and grandiose behavior. His eccentric manner and attention-grabbing public actions sometimes drew more attention than his artwork, to the dismay of those who held his work in high esteem, and to the irritation of his critics.\n\n	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Dal%C3%AD	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Dal%C3%AD.Rinoceronte.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Salvador_Dali_A_%28Dali_Atomicus%29_09633u.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/dd/The_Persistence_of_Memory.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Office-book.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Man_Ray_Salvador_Dali.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/Plaza_de_Dal%C3%AD_%28Madrid%29_08.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Salvador_Dali_NYWTS.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Salvador_Dali_Crypt_in_Figueres.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Salvador_Dal%C3%AD_1939.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Salvador_Dali_The_Rainbow_1972.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Dal%C3%AD.Perseo.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Dali_museum.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Ekebergparken_Salvador_Dali_1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Dal%C3%AD._Gala.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/20061227-Figueres_Sant_Pere_MQ.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Dali_Allan_Warren.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Children-at-Dali-exibition.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Hommage_%C3%A0_Newton.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Familia_Dal%C3%AD_%28h_1910%29.jpg"]	f	cover
364	Georges Seurat	Georges-Pierre Seurat (French: [ʒɔʁʒ pjɛʁ sœʁa]; 2 December 1859 – 29 March 1891) was a French Post-Impressionist painter and draftsman.\nHe is noted for his innovative use of drawing media and for devising the technique of painting known as pointillism. His large-scale work A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte (1884–1886) altered the direction of modern art by initiating Neo-impressionism.

377	Auguste Rodin	François-Auguste-René Rodin (12 November 1840 – 17 November 1917), known as Auguste Rodin (/oʊˈɡuːst roʊˈdæn/ oh-GOOST roh-DAN; French: [oɡyst ʁɔdɛ̃]), was a French sculptor. Although Rodin is generally considered the progenitor of modern sculpture, he did not set out to rebel against the past. He was schooled traditionally, took a craftsman-like approach to his work, and desired academic recognition, although he was never accepted into Paris's foremost school of art.\nSculpturally, Rodin possessed a unique ability to model a complex, turbulent, deeply pocketed surface in clay. Many of his most notable sculptures were roundly criticized during his lifetime. They clashed with the predominant figure sculpture tradition, in which works were decorative, formulaic, or highly thematic. Rodin's most original work departed from traditional themes of mythology and allegory, modeled the human body with realism, and celebrated individual character and physicality. Rodin was sensitive to the controversy surrounding his work, but refused to change his style. Successive works brought increasing favor from the government and the artistic community.\nFrom the unexpected realism of his first major figure – inspired by his 1875 trip to Italy – to the unconventional memorials whose commissions he later sought, Rodin's reputation grew, such that he became the preeminent French sculptor of his time. By 1900, he was a world-renowned artist. Wealthy private clients sought Rodin's work after his World's Fair exhibit, and he kept company with a variety of high-profile intellectuals and artists. He married his lifelong companion, Rose Beuret, in the last year of both their lives. His sculptures suffered a decline in popularity after his death in 1917, but within a few decades, his legacy solidified. Rodin remains one of the few sculptors widely known outside the visual arts community.	\N	\N	\N	http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ub0nZtzVT7Y/UKA57kV2T3I/AAAAAAAABK4/ocgpvWmYD50/s1600/auguste%2Brodin%252527s%2B172th%2B1.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Rodin	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Z%C3%BCrich_-_Kunsthaus_-_Rodin%27s_H%C3%B6llentor_IMG_7384_ShiftN.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Monument_to_Balzac.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Legros_-buste_de_Rodin_%28dessin%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Rodin-cropped.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Musee_Rodin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Rodin_The_bronze_age.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Rodin_The_Shade.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/St-John-the-Baptist-Preaching.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Rodin_p1070095.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/The_Thinker%2C_Rodin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/The.burg.of.calais.london.arp.750pix.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/43/Kiss_Rodin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Auguste_Rodin_portrait_middle_aged.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Auguste_Rodin_-_Monument_to_Victor_Hugo.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Brooklyn_Museum_-_M._Auguste_Rodin_-_Edward_Steichen.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Auguste_Rodin_signature.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Age_of_bronze_plaster.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Auguste_Rodin%2C_Paris%2C_c1862_by_Charles_Hippolyte_Aubry.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Auguste_Rodin%2C_1881-ca.1899%2C_%C3%89ve%2C_bronze%2C_Jardin_des_Tuilleries%2C_Paris._DSC09221.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Camille_Claudel.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-R38535%2C_Auguste_Rodin.jpg"]	f	contain
389	Muhammad	Abū al-Qāsim Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib ibn Hāshim (Arabic: ابو القاسم محمد ابن عبد الله ابن عبد المطلب ابن هاشم‎; c. 570 – c. 8 June 632), also transliterated as Muhammad (محمد), was a man from Mecca who unified Arabia into a single religious polity under Islam. Believed by Muslims and Bahá'ís to be a messenger and prophet of God, Muhammad, with the exception of Ahmadi Muslims, is almost universally considered by Muslims as the last prophet sent by God to mankind. While non-Muslims regard Muhammad to have been the founder of Islam, Muslims consider him to have restored the unaltered original monotheistic faith of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and other prophets.\nBorn in about 570 CE in the Arabian city of Mecca, Muhammad was orphaned at an early age and brought up under the care of his paternal uncle Abu Talib. He later worked mostly as a merchant, as well as a shepherd, and was first married at age 25. Being in the habit of periodically retreating to a cave in the surrounding mountains for several nights of seclusion and prayer, he later reported that it was there, at age 40, that he was visited by Gabriel and received his first revelation from God. Three years after this event Muhammad started preaching these revelations publicly, proclaiming that "God is One", that complete "surrender" to Him (lit. islām) is the only way (dīn) acceptable to God, and that he himself was a prophet and messenger of God, in the same vein as other Islamic prophets.\nMuhammad gained few followers early on, and was met with hostility from some Meccan tribes. To escape persecution, Muhammad sent some of his followers to Abyssinia before he and his followers in Mecca migrated to Medina (then known as Yathrib) in the year 622. This event, the Hijra, marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar, which is also known as the Hijri Calendar. In Medina, Muhammad united the tribes under the Constitution of Medina. After eight years of fighting with the Meccan tribes, his followers, who by then had grown to 10,000, took control of Mecca in the largely peaceful Conquest of Mecca. He destroyed the pagan idols in the city and then sent his followers out to destroy all of the remaining pagan temples in Eastern Arabia. In 632, a few months after returning to Medina from The Farewell Pilgrimage, Muhammad fell ill and died. By the time of his death, most of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam, and he had united Arabia into a single Muslim religious polity.\nThe revelations (each known as Ayah, lit. "Sign [of God]") which Muhammad reported receiving until his death form the verses of the Quran, regarded by Muslims as the "Word of God" and around which the religion is based. Besides the Quran, Muhammad's teachings and practices (sunnah), found in the Hadith and sira literature, are also upheld by Muslims and used as sources of Islamic law. Muslims discuss Muhammad and other prophets of Islam with reverence, adding the phrase peace be upon him whenever their names are mentioned. While conceptions of Muhammad in medieval Christendom and other premodern contexts were largely negative, appraisals in modern history have been far less unfavorable.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Hilye-i_serif_5.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Sahadah-Topkapi-Palace.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Siyer-i_Nebi_298a.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Surat_An-Najm.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Tribes_english.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Muhammad_Salat.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Muhammad_destroying_idols_-_L%27Histoire_Merveilleuse_en_Vers_de_Mahomet_BNF.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Muslim_Conquest.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Maome.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Magnify-clip.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/MiddleEast_blacky.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Masjid_al-Qiblatain.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Mohammad_SAV.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Mohamed_peace_be_upon_him.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Mohammed_receiving_revelation_from_the_angel_Gabriel.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Mohammed_kaaba_1315.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Muhammad2.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Mrs_Aisha_room.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Domeoftherock1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Cave_Hira.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Gagarin_PropovedMagometGRM.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Folio_from_a_Koran_%288th-9th_century%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Al-Aqsa_Mosque_by_David_Shankbone.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Allah1.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Allah-green.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Kabaa.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Madina_Haram_at_evening_.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/MASJID_NABAVI_dome_Minaret_12122008209.jpg"]	f	cover
397	Sun Yat-sen	Sun Yat-sen (12 November 1866 – 12 March 1925) was a Chinese revolutionary, first president and founding father of the Republic of China ("Nationalist China"). As the foremost pioneer of Republic of China, Sun is referred to as the "Father of the Nation" in the Republic of China (ROC), and the "forerunner of democratic revolution" in the People's Republic of China. Sun played an instrumental role in the overthrow of the Qing dynasty during the years leading up to the Double Ten Revolution. He was appointed to serve as Provisional President of the Republic of China, when it was founded in 1912. He later co-founded the Kuomintang (KMT), serving as its first leader. Sun was a uniting figure in post-Imperial China, and remains unique among 20th-century Chinese politicians for being widely revered amongst the people from both sides of the Taiwan Strait.\nAlthough Sun is considered one of the greatest leaders of modern China, his political life was one of constant struggle and frequent exile. After the success of the revolution, he quickly resigned, due to Beiyang Clique pressure, from his post as President of the newly founded Republic of China, and led successive revolutionary governments as a challenge to the warlords who controlled much of the nation. Sun did not live to see his party consolidate its power over the country during the Northern Expedition. His party, which formed a fragile alliance with the Communists, split into two factions after his death. Sun's chief legacy resides in his developing of the political philosophy known as the Three Principles of the People: nationalism, democracy, and the people's livelihood.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Yat-sen	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Taiwan-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Taiwan_10_Y%C3%BCan_1960_Pick_1969.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/The_document_bearing_Sun_Yat_Sen%27s_official_seal.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Whampoa3.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Sun_Yat_Sen_family.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Sun_and_Soong_in_Kobe.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Sun_yatsen_in_Tiananmen.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Sunyatsen1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Si_Da_Kou.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/R%C3%A9publique_de_Chine_%28Taiwan%29%2CYuan_%C3%A0_l%27effigie_du_pr%C3%A9sident_Dr.Sun_Yat-Sen.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Sun_Yat-Sen_plaque.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Sun-jat-sen_nanjing_140883.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Sun_Yat-sen_Mausoleum_at_1st_May_2011.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Sun_Yat-sen_Centre.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Sun_Yat-sen_as_A_School_Boy_In_Hawaii%2C_age_13.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Sun_Yat-sen_and_Chiang_Kai-shek.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Sun_Yat_Sen_Signature.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Sun_Yat_Sen_Nanyang_Memorial_Hall_22%2C_Aug_06.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Wuchangqiyi_paobing.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Flag_of_the_Republic_of_China_1912-1928.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Flag_of_the_Republic_of_China.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Letter_sun_yat_sen.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/HK_Central_Gage_Street_Pak_Tsz_Lane_Sun_Yat_Sen_Historical_Trail_2.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/China.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Emblem_of_the_Kuomintang.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Commander-in-Chief_Flag_of_the_Republic_of_China.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/NRA_Generals_Northern_Expedition.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Lumuzhenp.JPG"]	f	cover
102	Rump Parliament	The Rump Parliament is the English Parliament after Colonel Pride purged the Long Parliament on 6 December 1648 of those members hostile to the Grandees' intention to try King Charles I for high treason.\n"Rump" normally means the hind end of an animal; its use meaning "remnant" was first recorded in the above context. Since 1649, the term "rump parliament" has been used to refer to any parliament left over from the actual legitimate parliament.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rump_Parliament	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Coat_of_Arms_of_England_%281603-1649%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg"]	f	cover
64	Albrecht Dürer	Albrecht Dürer (German: [ˈalbʁɛçt ˈdyːʁɐ]; 21 May 1471 – 6 April 1528) was a German painter, engraver, printmaker, mathematician, and theorist from Nuremberg. His high-quality woodcuts (nowadays often called Meisterstiche or "master prints") established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties, and he has been conventionally regarded as the greatest artist of the Northern Renaissance ever since. His vast body of work includes altarpieces, religious works, numerous portraits and self-portraits, and copper engravings. The woodcuts, such as the Apocalypse series (1498), retain a more Gothic flavour than the rest of his work. His well-known prints include the Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513), Saint Jerome in his Study (1514) and Melencolia I (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation. His watercolours also mark him as one of the first European landscape artists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium.\nDürer's introduction of classical motifs into Northern art, through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists, has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance. This is reinforced by his theoretical treatises, which involve principles of mathematics, perspective and ideal proportions.	\N	\N	\N	http://www.nndb.com/people/023/000029933/Durer_26.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/D%C3%BCrer_Melancholia_I.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/D%C3%BCrer_Salvator_Mundi_detail.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Durer_foot.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Durer_selfporitrait.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Durerhaus-nbg.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/D%C3%BCrer_-_Rhinoceros.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Durer%2C_autoritratto_con_fiore_d%27eringio%2C_dett.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Durer_Adam_and_Eve.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Durer_Revelation_Four_Riders.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Durer_face_transforms.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer_012.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer_011.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer_094b.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer_058.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer_Saint_Jerome_1521.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer_Betende_H%C3%A4nde.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Duerer_%28Marter_der_zehntausend_Christen%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Chateau-fort-Durer.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Durer%2C_apocalisse%2C_08_battaglia_degli_angeli.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Durer%2C_apocalisse%2C_05_quinta_e_setsa_piaga.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Vier_Apostel_%28Albrecht_Duerer%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/St._Cristopher-D%C3%BCrer.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Self-portrait_at_13_by_Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Selbstportr%C3%A4t%2C_by_Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer%2C_from_Prado_in_Google_Earth.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/N%C3%BCrnberger_Feldschlange.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Innsbruck_castle_courtyard.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Gallowglass_-_D%C3%BCrer.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer_-_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_House_of_D%C3%BCrer_-_WGA07258.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer_-_Adorazione_dei_Magi_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer_-_Portrait_of_Oswolt_Krel_-_WGA6934.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer_-_Jesus_among_the_Doctors_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Albrecht-self.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer_-_Ritratto_del_padre_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Albrecht_Duerer-_Lamentation_for_Christ.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/AlbrechtD%C3%BCrer01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer_010.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer_-_Young_Hare_-_WGA07362.jpg"]	f	contain

404	Marcel Duchamp	Marcel Duchamp (French: [maʁsɛl dyʃɑ̃]; 28 July 1887 – 2 October 1968) was a French-American painter, sculptor, chess player, and writer whose work is associated with Dadaism and conceptual art, although not directly associated with Dada groups. Duchamp is commonly regarded, along with Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse, as one of the three artists who helped to define the revolutionary developments in the plastic arts in the opening decades of the twentieth century, responsible for significant developments in painting and sculpture. Duchamp has had an immense impact on twentieth-century and twenty first-century art. By World War I, he had rejected the work of many of his fellow artists (like Henri Matisse) as "retinal" art, intended only to please the eye. Instead, Duchamp wanted to put art back in the service of the mind.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Duchamp	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c0/Duchamp_-_Nude_Descending_a_Staircase.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/be/Duchamp_LargeGlass.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/25/Etant_donnes.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/RroseSelavy.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Marcel_Duchamp%2C_Jacques_Villon%2C_Raymond_Duchamp-Villon_in_the_garden_of_Villon%27s_studio%2C_Puteaux%2C_France%2C_c.1913.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Wikinews-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Blainville-Crevon%2CNormandy%2CFrance.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Marcel_Duchamp%27s_grave_in_Rouen%2C_France.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Duchamp_Fountaine.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/95/Marcel_Duchamp_playing_chess_%28photo_by_Kay_Bell_Reynal%2C_1952%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/20/Marcel_Duchamp%2C_1911-12%2C_Nude_%28Study%29%2C_Sad_Young_Man_on_a_Train_%28Nu_-esquisse-%2C_jeune_homme_triste_dans_un_train%29%2C_Peggy_Guggenheim_Collection%2C_Venice.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg"]	f	cover
411	Franz Kafka	Franz Kafka (3 July 1883 – 3 June 1924) was a German-language writer of novels and short stories, regarded by critics as one of the most influential authors of the 20th century. Kafka strongly influenced genres such as existentialism. Most of his works, such as "Die Verwandlung" ("The Metamorphosis"), Der Prozess (The Trial), and Das Schloss (The Castle), are filled with the themes and archetypes of alienation, physical and psychological brutality, parent–child conflict, characters on a terrifying quest, labyrinths of bureaucracy, and mystical transformations.\nKafka was born into a middle-class, German-speaking Jewish family in Prague, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In his lifetime, most of the population of Prague spoke Czech, and the division between Czech- and German-speaking people was a tangible reality, as both groups were strengthening their national identity. The Jewish community often found itself in between the two sentiments, naturally raising questions about a place to which one belongs. Kafka himself was fluent in both languages, considering German his mother tongue.\nKafka trained as a lawyer and, after completing his legal education, obtained employment with an insurance company. He began to write short stories in his spare time. For the rest of his life, he complained about the little time he had to devote to what he came to regard as his calling. He regretted having to devote so much attention to his Brotberuf ("day job", literally "bread job"). Kafka preferred to communicate by letter; he wrote hundreds of letters to family and close female friends, including his father, his fiancée Felice Bauer, and his youngest sister Ottla. He had a complicated and troubled relationship with his father that had a major effect on his writing. He also suffered conflict over being Jewish, feeling that it had little to do with him, although critics argue that it influenced his writing.\nOnly a few of Kafka's works were published during his lifetime: the story collections Betrachtung (Contemplation) and Ein Landarzt (A Country Doctor), and individual stories (such as "Die Verwandlung") in literary magazines. He prepared the story collection Ein Hungerkünstler (A Hunger Artist) for print, but it was not published until after his death. Kafka's unfinished works, including his novels Der Prozess, Das Schloss and Amerika (also known as Der Verschollene, The Man Who Disappeared), were published posthumously, mostly by his friend Max Brod, who ignored Kafka's wish to have the manuscripts destroyed. Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre are among the writers influenced by Kafka's work; the term Kafkaesque has entered the English language to describe surreal situations like those in his writing.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Kafka	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/Na_Porici_7%2C_Prague.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Kafka_statue_Prague.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Franz_Kafka_1910.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Franz_Kafka%27s_signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Kafka_Betrachtung_1912.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Grave_of_Kafka.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Czech-2013-Prague-Plaque_%28birthplace_of_Franz_Kafka%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Prague_Palace_Kinsky_PC.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Franz-Kafka%2C-etching%28author-Jan-Hlad%C3%ADk-1978%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/De_Kafka_Brief_an_den_Vater_001.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Kafka_portrait.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Kafka_Das_Schloss_1926.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Wikidata-logo.svg"]	f	cover
458	Central Intelligence Agency	The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is one of the principal intelligence-gathering agencies of the United States federal government. The CIA's headquarters is in Langley, Virginia, a few miles west of Washington, D.C. Its employees operate from U.S. embassies and many other locations around the world. The only independent U.S. intelligence agency, it reports to the Director of National Intelligence.\nThe CIA has three traditional principal activities, which are gathering information about foreign governments, corporations, and individuals; analyzing that information, along with intelligence gathered by other U.S. intelligence agencies, in order to provide national security intelligence assessment to senior United States policymakers; and, upon the request of the President of the United States, carrying out or overseeing covert activities and some tactical operations by its own employees, by members of the U.S. military, or by other partners. It can, for example, exert foreign political influence through its tactical divisions, such as the Special Activities Division.\nIn 2013, the Washington Post reported that the CIA's share of the National Intelligence Program (NIP), a non-military component of the overall US Intelligence Community Budget, has increased to 28% in 2013, exceeding the NIP funding received by military agencies the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and the National Security Agency (NSA). The CIA has increasingly taken on offensive roles, including covert paramilitary operations. One of its largest divisions, the Information Operations Center (IOC), has shifted focus from counter-terrorism to offensive cyber-operations.\nSeveral CIA activities have attracted criticism. They include nonconsentual human experiments, extraordinary rendition, enhanced interrogation techniques, targeted killings, assassinations and the funding and training of militants who would go on to kill civilians and non-combatants.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/US-CentralIntelligenceAgency-Seal.svg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Lockheed_SR-71_Blackbird.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Usaf.u2.750pix.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Wikinews-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Fbi_duquesne.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Great_Seal_of_the_United_States_%28obverse%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Flag_of_the_United_States_Central_Intelligence_Agency.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Kh-4b_corona.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/John_Brennan_CIA_official_portrait.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Nhb-exterior-020.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/National_Park_Service_9-11_Statue_of_Liberty_and_WTC_fire.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/President_Ford_meets_with_CIA_Director-designate_George_Bush_-_NARA_-_7141445.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/United_States_Intelligence_Community_Seal_2008.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/US-CentralIntelligenceAgency-Seal.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/CIA_ORG_Structure.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/CIA.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Cia-memorial-wall.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Cia-lobby-seal.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/A_bounty_leaflect_prepared_by_the_USA_for_use_in_Afghanistan_%28front%29_-a.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Annex_No._30_Phase_1_Pre_Strike_-_NARA_-_193244.tif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Aerial_view_of_the_Central_Intelligence_Agency_headquarters%2C_Langley%2C_Virginia_16449v.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Defense.gov_News_Photo_070208-D-7203T-015.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Cia-mi17.jpg"]	f	cover
428	Yalta Conference	The Yalta Conference, sometimes called the Crimea Conference and codenamed the Argonaut Conference, held February 4–11, 1945, was the World War II meeting of the heads of government of the United States, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, represented by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Premier Joseph Stalin, respectively, for the purpose of discussing Europe's post-war reorganization. The conference convened in the Livadia Palace near Yalta in Crimea.\nThe meeting was intended mainly to discuss the re-establishment of the nations of war-torn Europe. Within a few years, with the Cold War dividing the continent, Yalta became a subject of intense controversy. To some extent, it has remained controversial.\nYalta was the second of three wartime conferences among the Big Three. It had been preceded by the Tehran Conference in 1943, and was followed by the Potsdam Conference in July 1945, which was attended by Stalin, Churchill (who was replaced midpoint by the newly elected British Prime Minister Clement Attlee) and Harry S Truman, who had replaced the late President Roosevelt.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Yalta_Conference_%28Churchill%2C_Roosevelt%2C_Stalin%29_%28B%26W%29.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yalta_Conference	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5c/Symbol_template_class.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Yalta_Conference_%28Churchill%2C_Roosevelt%2C_Stalin%29_%28B%26W%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/JStalin_Secretary_general_CCCP_1942_flipped.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Germany_Morgenthau_Plan.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Map-Germany-1945.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Livadiya_Conference.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/1945-02-15GerWW2BattlefrontAtlas.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Duitslandroosevelt.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Duitslandchurchill.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Map_of_Poland_%281945%29_corr.png"]	f	cover
74	Hundred Years' War	The Hundred Years' War, a series of conflicts waged from 1337 to 1453, pitted the Kingdom of England against the Valois Capetians for control of the French throne. Each side drew many allies into the fighting.\nThe war had its roots in a dynastic disagreement dating back to the time of William the Conqueror, who became King of England in 1066 while retaining possession of the Duchy of Normandy in France. As the rulers of Normandy and other lands on the continent, the English kings owed feudal homage to the King of France. In 1337, Edward III of England refused to pay homage to Philip VI of France, leading the French King to claim confiscation of Edward's lands in Aquitaine.\nEdward responded by declaring himself to be the rightful King of France rather than Philip, a claim dating to 1328 when Edward's uncle, Charles IV of France, died without a direct male heir. Edward was the closest male relative of the dead king, as son of Isabella of France who was a daughter of Philip IV of France and a sister of Charles IV. But instead, the dead king's cousin, Philip VI, the son of Philip IV's younger brother, Charles, Count of Valois, had become King of France in accordance with Salic law, which disqualified the succession of males descended through female lines. The question of legal succession to the French crown was central to the war over generations of English and French claimants.\nHistorians commonly divide the war into three phases separated by truces:\nthe Edwardian Era War (1337–60)\nthe Caroline War (1369–89)\nthe Lancastrian War (1415–53), which saw the slow decline of English fortunes after the appearance of Joan of Arc in 1429\nContemporary European conflicts directly related to this conflict included the War of the Breton Succession (1341–1364), the Castilian Civil War (1366–1369), the War of the Two Peters (1356–1375) in Aragon, and the 1383–85 Crisis in Portugal. Later historians invented the term "Hundred Years' War" as a periodization to encompass all of these events, thus constructing the longest military conflict in history.\nThe war owes its historical significance to multiple factors. By its end, feudal armies had been largely replaced by professional troops, and aristocratic dominance had yielded to a democratisation of the manpower and weapons of armies. Although primarily a dynastic conflict, the war gave impetus to ideas of French and English nationalism. It saw the wider introduction of weapons and tactics that supplanted the feudal armies where the use of heavy cavalry had dominated. The first standing armies in Western Europe since the time of the Western Roman Empire originated during the war, composed largely of commoners and thus helping to change their role in warfare. With respect to the belligerents, English political forces over time came to oppose the costly venture; while the dissatisfaction of English nobles, resulting from the loss of their continental landholdings, became a factor leading to the civil wars known as the Wars of the Roses (1455–1487). In France, civil wars, deadly epidemics, famines and bandit free-companies of mercenaries reduced the population drastically.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/BattleofSluys.jpeg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Years%27_War	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Vigiles_du_roi_Charles_VII_32.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Edward_III_counting_the_dead_on_the_battlefield_of_Cr%C3%A9cy.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Du_Guesclin_Dinan.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Hundred_Years%27_War_montage.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Hommage_of_Edward_I_to_Philippe_le_Bel.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Ofensivas_Tovar-Vienne_contra_Inglaterra_01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Joan_of_arc_miniature_graded.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Royal_Arms_of_the_Kingdom_of_Scotland.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Royal_Arms_of_England_%281399-1603%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/TimeLine100YearsWar_%28cropped%29.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Siege_orleans.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Blason_fr_Bourgogne.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Blason_France_moderne.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Charles_VII_by_Jean_Fouquet_1445_1450.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Bubonic_plague_map.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Agincourt_miniature.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/BattleofSluys.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Assassinat_louis_orleans.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Cr%C3%A9cy_-_Grandes_Chroniques_de_France.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Clan_member_crest_badge_-_Clan_Carmichael.svg"]	f	cover
186	Edward Gibbon	Edward Gibbon (8 May 1737 – 16 January 1794) was an English historian and Member of Parliament. His most important work, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, was published in six volumes between 1776 and 1788. The Decline and Fall is known for the quality and irony of its prose, its use of primary sources, and its open criticism of organised religion.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Gibbon	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Edward_Gibbon_by_Henry_Walton_cleaned.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Blue_Plaque_-_Edward_Gibbon.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Keep_of_Portchester_Castle%2C_2008.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Edward_Emily_Gibbon.jpg"]	f	cover
304	Jeremy Bentham	Jeremy Bentham (/ˈbɛnθəm/; 15 February [O.S. 4 February] 1748 – 6 June 1832) was a British philosopher, jurist, and social reformer. He is regarded as the founder of modern utilitarianism.\nBentham became a leading theorist in Anglo-American philosophy of law, and a political radical whose ideas influenced the development of welfarism. He advocated individual and economic freedom, the separation of church and state, freedom of expression, equal rights for women, the right to divorce, and the decriminalising of homosexual acts. He called for the abolition of slavery, the abolition of the death penalty, and the abolition of physical punishment, including that of children. He has also become known in recent years as an early advocate of animal rights. Though strongly in favour of the extension of individual legal rights, he opposed the idea of natural law and natural rights, calling them "nonsense upon stilts".\nBentham's students included his secretary and collaborator James Mill, the latter's son, John Stuart Mill, the legal philosopher John Austin, as well as Robert Owen, one of the founders of utopian socialism. Bentham has been described as the "spiritual founder" of University College London, though he played little direct part in its foundation.	\N	\N	\N	http://img.tfd.com/WEAL/weal_02_img0210.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Paw_%28Animal_Rights_symbol%29.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Jeremy_Bentham_signature.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/UCL_Flaxman_Gallery_and_Jeremy_Bentham.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/People_icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Jeremy_Bentham_Auto-Icon.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Jeremy_Bentham_by_Thomas_Frye.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Jeremy_Bentham_by_Henry_William_Pickersgill_detail.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3e/Jeremy_Bentham_House.jpg"]	f	60%
227	Townshend Acts	The Townshend Acts were a series of acts passed, beginning in 1767, by the Parliament of Great Britain relating to the British colonies in North America. The acts are named after Charles Townshend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who proposed the program. Historians vary slightly in which acts they include under the heading "Townshend Acts", but five laws are often mentioned: the Revenue Act of 1767, the Indemnity Act, the Commissioners of Customs Act, the Vice Admiralty Court Act, and the New York Restraining Act. The purpose of the Townshend Acts was to raise revenue in the colonies to pay the salaries of governors and judges so that they would remain loyal to Great Britain, to create a more effective means of enforcing compliance with trade regulations, to punish the province of New York for failing to comply with the 1765 Quartering Act, and to establish the precedent that the British Parliament had the right to tax the colonies. The Townshend Acts were met with resistance in the colonies, prompting the occupation of Boston by British troops in 1768, which eventually resulted in the Boston Massacre of 1770.\nAs a result of widespread protest in the American colonies, Parliament began to consider a motion to partially repeal the Townshend duties. Most of the new taxes were repealed, but the tax on tea was retained. The British government continued in its attempt to tax the colonists without their consent and the Boston Tea Party and the American Revolution followed.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townshend_Acts	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Boston_1768.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Dickinson_Farmer_Letters.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/CharlesTownshend.jpg"]	f	cover
190	Egalitarianism	Egalitarianism (from French égal, meaning "equal")—or, rarely, equalitarianism—is a trend of thought that favors equality for all people. Egalitarian doctrines maintain that all humans are equal in fundamental worth or social status, according to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, the term has two distinct definitions in modern English. It is defined either as a political doctrine that all people should be treated as equals and have the same political, economic, social, and civil rights or as a social philosophy advocating the removal of economic inequalities among people or the decentralisation of power. Some sources define egalitarianism as the point of view that equality reflects the natural state of humanity.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egalitarianism	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/01/A_coloured_voting_box.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Egalitarian_and_equality_logo.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Yellow_flag_waving.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg"]	f	cover
497	Imperialism	Imperialism, as defined by the Dictionary of Human Geography, is "an unequal human and territorial relationship, usually in the form of an empire, based on ideas of superiority and practices of dominance, and involving the extension of authority and control of one state or people over another." Lewis Samuel Feuer identifies two major subtypes of imperialism; the first is the "regressive imperialism" identified with pure conquest, unequivocal exploitation, extermination or reductions of undesired peoples, and settlement of desired peoples into those territories. The second type identified by Feuer is "progressive imperialism" that is founded upon a cosmopolitan view of humanity, that promotes the spread of civilization to allegedly backward societies to elevate living standards and culture in conquered territories, and allowance of a conquered people to assimilate into the imperial society, an example being the British Empire which claimed to give their "citizens" a number of advantages. \nThe term as such primarily has been applied to Western political and economic dominance in the 19th and 20th centuries. Some writers, such as Edward Said, use the term more broadly to describe any system of domination and subordination organized with an imperial center and a periphery. According to Marxist theorist Vladimir Lenin, imperialism is a natural feature of a developed capitalist nation state as it matures into monopoly capitalism. In his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism, Lenin observed that as capitalism matured in the Western world, the economy shifted away from real commodity production towards banking and finance, as commodity production was outsourced to the empires' colonies. Lenin concluded that the competition between empires and the unfettered drive to maximise profit would lead to wars between the empires themselves, such as World War I in his contemporary time, as well as continued future military invasions and occupations in the undeveloped world to establish and expand markets and exploit cheap labour for the monopolist corporations of the empires.\nIt is mostly accepted that modern-day colonialism is an expression of imperialism and cannot exist without the latter. The extent to which "informal" imperialism with no formal colonies is properly described as such remains a controversial topic among historians.\nThe word imperialism became common in the United Kingdom in the 1870s and was used with a negative connotation. In Great Britain, the word had until then mostly been used to refer to the politics of Napoléon III of obtaining favorable public opinion in France through military interventions outside France.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Soviet_empire_1960.png	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Punch_Rhodes_Colossus.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/The_British_Empire.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Colonial_Africa_1913_map.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Soviet_empire_1960.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/McKinley_Destroys_Imperialism_Straw_Man.jpg"]	f	cover
459	United States	The United States of America (USA)—commonly referred to as the United States (U.S.), the States or simply America—is a federal republic consisting of 50 states and a federal district. The 48 contiguous states and the federal district of Washington, D.C., are in central North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is the northwestern part of North America and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The country also has five populated and nine unpopulated territories in the Pacific and the Caribbean. At 3.79 million square miles (9.83 million km2) in total and with around 317 million people, the United States is the fourth-largest country by total area and third largest by population. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate of the United States is also extremely diverse, and it is home to a wide variety of wildlife.\nPaleo-indians migrated from Asia to what is now the U.S. mainland around 15,000 years ago, with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard. Disputes between Great Britain and these colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of Independence. The ensuing war ended in 1783 with the recognition of independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787. The first 10 amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and guarantee many fundamental civil rights and freedoms.\nDriven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century. This involved displacing native tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states. The American Civil War ended legal slavery in the country. By the end of the 19th century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy was the world's largest. The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country with nuclear weapons, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States as the sole superpower.\nThe United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national economy, with an estimated GDP in 2013 of $16.7 trillion—23% of global nominal GDP and 19% at purchasing-power parity. The economy is fueled by an abundance of natural resources and the world's highest worker productivity, with per capita GDP being the world's sixth-highest in 2010. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, it continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers. The U.S. has the highest mean and second-highest median household income in the OECD as well as the highest average wage, though it has the fourth most unequal income distribution among OECD nations with roughly 16% of the population living in poverty. The country accounts for 39% of global military spending, being the world's foremost economic and military power, a prominent political and cultural force, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovation.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/1235px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Flag_of_Texas.svg",

203	Joseph II	Jews have a long history in the region now known as Hungary, with some records even predating the 895 AD Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin by over 600 years. By the early 20th century, the community had grown to constitute 5% of Hungary's total population and 23% of the population of the capital, Budapest. Jews became prominent in science, the arts and business. During the last years of World War II, they suffered severely, with over 600,000 being killed (within Hungary's 1943 borders) between 1941 and 1945, mainly through deportation to Nazi German-run extermination camps.\nToday, the population of Jews living in Hungary is around 120,000 with 110,000 mostly concentrated in Budapest, although 2011 census data show only 10,965 (0.11%) self-identified religious Jews, of whom 10,553 (96.2%) declared themselves as ethnic Hungarian. The intermarriage rates for Hungarian Jews is around 60%.[citation needed] There are many active synagogues in Hungary, including the Dohány Street Synagogue, the largest synagogue in Europe and the Eastern Hemisphere, and the second largest synagogue in the world after the Temple Emanu-El in New York City.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_II	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/62/PD-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Vasvari_Pal_St_Synagogue_Pest_Hungary.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Rumbach_St_Synagogue_Pest_Hungary_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Star_of_David.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Synagogue_Sopron_Hungary.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/Ullmann_M%C3%B3ric.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/57/Josef_II_medal.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/In_front_of_the_Gr%C3%BCnbaum_grocery_shop.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Hegedus_Gyula_Utca_Synagogue_Pest_Hungary.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Jewish_cemetery_tombs_Timisoara_Romania.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Jewish_Hungarian_country_girl_in_1928.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/Memorial_of_the_Hungarian_Jewish_Martyrs.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Kazinczy_St_Orthodox_Synagogue_Pest_Hungary.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Part_of_the_store-owners_family.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Old_neoclassic_Synagogue_Szeged_Hungary.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Pottery_artifacts_Synagogue_Sopron_Hungary.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/People_icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/89/Selection_Birkenau_ramp.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Carl_Lutz_Righteous_Among_Nations_Plaque_Washington%2C_DC.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-N0827-318%2C_KZ_Auschwitz%2C_Ankunft_ungarischer_Juden.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Dohany_Street_Synagogue_Pest_Hungary.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Coat_of_Arms_of_Hungary.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Adolf_Eichmann_at_Trial1961.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Bundesarchiv_Bild_101I-680-8285A-08%2C_Budapest%2C_Festnahme_von_Juden.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Budapest_Hungary_Holocaust_Shoe_Memorial_Danube.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Flag_of_Hungary.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Falk_Miksa.JPG"]	f	cover
424	Volgograd	Volgograd (Russian: Волгогра́д, IPA: [vəlɡɐˈɡrat] ( )), formerly Tsaritsyn (Russian:  Цари́цын​ ), 1589–1925, and Stalingrad (Russian:  Сталингра́д​ ), 1925–1961, is an important industrial city and the administrative center of Volgograd Oblast, Russia. It is 80 kilometers (50 mi) long, north to south. It is situated on the western bank of the Volga River. The population is 1,021,215 (2010 Census); 1,011,417 (2002 Census); 1,022,578 (1989 Census).\nThe city became famous for its resistance, and the extensive physical damage and death toll it suffered, during the Battle of Stalingrad against the German Army in World War II. Starting in 2013, for nine days every year, the city may be officially referred to as "Stalingrad".	\N	\N	\N	http://jobs.languagelink.ru/images/mpics/volgograd1.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volgograd	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0c/Red_pog.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Volgograd_-_Building_of_Regional_Committee_of_KPSS_and_Executive_Committee_002.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Volgograd_1979.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Ru-Tsaritsyn.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Ru-Volgograd.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/VLG_collage.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Map_of_Russia_-_Volgograd_Oblast_%282008-03%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Outline_Map_of_Volgograd_Oblast.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Ru-Stalingrad.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/41/Flag_of_India.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Flag_of_Ohio.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Flag_of_Florida.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Flag_of_Serbia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Flag_of_Pennsylvania.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Flag_of_the_Czech_Republic.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Flag_of_Volgograd_Oblast.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Gogolya_str.%2C_Tsaritsyn_%281914%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Flag_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Map_Tsaritsyn_1909.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/03/Flag_of_Italy.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9e/Flag_of_Japan.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Voroshilovskiy_district_of_Volgograd_001.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Volgograd_flag.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Volgograd_Synagogue.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Flag_of_Azerbaijan.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Flag_of_Armenia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Flag_of_Bulgaria.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Flag_of_Belgium_%28civil%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Coat_of_Arms_of_Volgograd.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Coat_of_Arms_of_Volgograd_oblast.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Coat_of_Arms_of_Volgograd_%28Tsaritsyn_Volgograd_oblast%29_%281857%29.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Flag_of_Finland.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Flag_of_Egypt.svg"]	f	cover
314	David Livingstone	David Livingstone (19 March 1813 – 1 May 1873) was a Scottish Congregationalist pioneer medical missionary with the London Missionary Society and an explorer in Africa. His meeting with H. M. Stanley on 10 November 1871 gave rise to the popular quotation "Dr. Livingstone, I presume?" Perhaps one of the most popular national heroes of the late 19th century in Victorian Britain, Livingstone had a mythic status, which operated on a number of interconnected levels: Protestant missionary martyr, working-class "rags to riches" inspirational story, scientific investigator and explorer, imperial reformer, anti-slavery crusader, and advocate of commercial empire. His fame as an explorer helped drive forward the obsession with discovering the sources of the River Nile that formed the culmination of the classic period of European geographical discovery and colonial penetration of the African continent.[citation needed]\nAt the same time his missionary travels, "disappearance" and death in Africa, and subsequent glorification as posthumous national hero in 1874 led to the founding of several major central African Christian missionary initiatives carried forward in the era of the European "Scramble for Africa".	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Map_livingstone_travels_africa.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Livingstone	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Map_livingstone_travels_africa.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Livingstone_statue2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/The_Slave_Gang_%28relates_to_David_Livingstone%29_by_The_London_Missionary_Society.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/David_Livingstone_statue%2C_Glasgow.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/David_Livingstone_memorial_at_Victoria_Falls%2C_Zimbabwe.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Livingstone_03.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/David_Livingstone_statue%2C_Princes_Street_Gardens%2C_Edinburgh.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Birthplace_of_david_livingstone.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/MaryMoffatGravestone.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/David_Livingstone_by_Frederick_Havill.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/David_Livingstone.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Stanley_-_Comment%E2%80%A6_11.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/Livingstone_Memorial%2C_Tanzania.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Livingstone_House%2C_Mikindani%2C_Tanzania.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Preaching_from_a_Waggon_%28David_Livingstone%29_by_The_London_Missionary_Society.jpg"]	f	cover
213	Jean-Antoine Watteau	Jean-Antoine Watteau (French: [ʒan‿ɑ̃twan wato]; baptised October 10, 1684 – July 18, 1721) better known as Antoine Watteau was a French painter whose brief career spurred the revival of interest in colour and movement (in the tradition of Correggio and Rubens). He revitalized the waning Baroque style, and indeed moved it to the less severe, more naturalistic, less formally classical Rococo.\nWatteau is credited with inventing the genre of fêtes galantes: scenes of bucolic and idyllic charm, suffused with an air of theatricality. Some of his best known subjects were drawn from the world of Italian comedy and ballet.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Antoine_Watteau	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Jean-Antoine_Watteau_-_Mezzetin.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/WatteauPierrot.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Watteau%2C_Antoine_-_Quellnymphe_-_1708.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Gersaint.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/WatteauLes_Fetesvenitiennes.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Jean-Antoine_Watteau_La_Surprise%2C_oil_on_panel.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Antoine_Watteau_-_The_Love_Lesson_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Antoine_Watteau_-_The_Festival_of_Love_-_WGA25460.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Antoine_Watteau_012.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Antoine_Watteau_001.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Antoine_Watteau_-_L%27imbarco_per_Citera.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Jean-Antoine_Watteau_-_The_Love_Song.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Antoine_Watteau_-_The_Dance_-_WGA25477.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Antoine_Watteau_-_Pierrot_Content_-_WGA25440.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Watteau_Polish_woman.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Rosalba_Carriera_Portrait_Antoine_Watteau.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Antoine_Watteau_056.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Antoine_Watteau_030.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/L%27Embarquement_pour_Cythere%2C_by_Antoine_Watteau%2C_from_C2RMF_retouched.jpg"]	f	cover
385	Nicholas II of Russia	Nicholas II (Russian: Николай II, Николай Александрович Романов, tr. Nikolay II, Nikolay Alexandrovich Romanov [nʲɪkɐˈlaj ftɐˈroj, nʲɪkɐˈlaj əlʲɪkˈsandrəvʲɪtɕ rɐˈmanəf]) (18 May [O.S. 6 May] 1868 – 17 July 1918) was the last Emperor of Russia, Grand Duke of Finland, and titular King of Poland. His official short title was Nicholas II, Emperor and Autocrat of All the Russias. Like other Russian Emperors he is commonly known by the monarchical title Tsar (though Russia formally ended the Tsardom in 1721). He is known as Saint Nicholas the Passion-Bearer by the Russian Orthodox Church and has been referred to as Saint Nicholas the Martyr.\nNicholas II ruled from 1 November 1894 until his forced abdication on 2 March 1917. His reign saw Imperial Russia go from being one of the foremost great powers of the world to economic and military collapse. Enemies nicknamed him Nicholas the Bloody because of the Khodynka Tragedy, the anti-Semitic pogroms, Bloody Sunday, his violent suppression of the 1905 Revolution, his execution of political opponents, and his pursuit of military campaigns on an unprecedented scale.\nUnder his rule, Russia was humiliatingly defeated in the Russo-Japanese War, which saw the almost total annihilation of the Russian Baltic Fleet at the Battle of Tsushima. The Anglo-Russian Entente, designed to counter German attempts to gain influence in the Middle East, ended the Great Game between Russia and the United Kingdom. As head of state, Nicholas approved the Russian mobilisation of August 1914, which marked the beginning of Russia's involvement in the First World War, a war in which 3.3 million Russians were killed. The Imperial Army's severe losses and the High Command's incompetent handling of the war, along with other policies directed by Nicholas during his reign, are often cited as the leading causes of the fall of the Romanov dynasty.[citation needed]\nNicholas II abdicated following the February Revolution of 1917 during which he and his family were imprisoned first in the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo, then later in the Governor's Mansion in Tobolsk, and finally at the Ipatiev House in Yekaterinburg. In the spring of 1918, Nicholas was handed over to the local Ural soviet by commissar Vasili Yakovlev who was then presented with a written receipt as Nicholas was formally handed over like a parcel. Nicholas II; his wife, Alexandra Feodorovna; his son, Alexei Nikolaevich; his four daughters, Olga Nikolaevna, Tatiana Nikolaevna, Maria Nikolaevna and Anastasia Nikolaevna; the family's medical doctor, Evgeny Botkin; the Emperor's footman, Alexei Trupp; the Empress' maidservant, Anna Demidova; and the family's cook, Ivan Kharitonov, were executed in the same room by the Bolsheviks on the night of 16/17 July 1918. This led to the canonisation of Nicholas II, his wife the Empress Alexandra and their children as passion bearers, a category used to identify believers who, in imitation of Christ, endured suffering and death at the hands of political enemies, on 15 August 2000 by the Russian Orthodox Church within Russia and, in 1981, as martyrs by the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia, located in New York City.\nAt the time of his death, his net worth was $900 million, which is the inflation adjusted equivalent to $13.7 billion in 2012 US dollars.	\N	\N	\N	http://russiapedia.rt.com/files/prominent-russians/the-romanov-dynasty/nicholas-ii/nicholas-ii_2-t.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_II_of_Russia	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9e/Flag_of_Japan.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4c/Flag_of_Sweden.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Nicholas_II_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Nicholas_II_of_Russia_1892.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Lesser_CoA_of_the_empire_of_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Lesser_Coat_of_Arms_of_Russian_Empire.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Mikola_II.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Nicholas_II%2C_Tsar.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/GrandDuchessMaria1914formal2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Imperial_Coat_of_arms_of_Russia_%2817th_century%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Imperial_Monogram_of_Tsar_Nicholas_II_of_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0a/Nicholas_II_Coin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/84/Tsar_Nicholas_II_%26_King_George_V.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Grand_Duchess_Anastasia_Nikolaevna_Crisco_edit_letters_removed.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Flag_of_Bulgaria.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Flag_of_Belgium_%28civil%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Flag_of_Empire_of_Brazil_%281822-1870%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Flag_of_Denmark.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Flag_of_Hungary.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Flag_of_Greece.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Flag_of_Portugal.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Flag_of_Italy_%281861-1946%29_crowned.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Flag_of_Thailand.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Flag_of_Prussia_1892-1918.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9a/Flag_of_Spain.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/%D0%93%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%A0%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BF%D1%83%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BD_%281914-1916%29b.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/TsarevichAlexeiNikolaievichOfRussia--nsillustratedwar04londuoft.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Tobolskhouse2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Tatiana_Nikolaevna.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Russian_prisoners_tannenberg.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Prince_Nicolas_at_Nagasaki.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Olgachair.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Oleg-cruiser.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Nikolaus_II._%28Russland%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Coat_of_Arms_of_Russian_Empire.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/ChurchOn_Blood.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Czar_Nicholas_II_of_Russia_%281868-1917%29_%281905%29.ogv", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Coat_of_arms_of_Russia_%28XV_Century%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Alexis.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/China_Qing_Dynasty_Flag_1889.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-R43302%2C_Kaiser_Wilhelm_II._und_Zar_Nikolaus_II..jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Flag_of_Bavaria_%28lozengy%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Engagement_official_picture_of_Alexandra_and_Nicholas.jpg"]	f	65%
76	Rough Wooing	The Rough Wooing (December 1543 – March 1550) was a conflict between Scotland and England. War was declared by Henry VIII of England, in an attempt to force the Scots to agree to a marriage between his son Edward and the infant Mary, Queen of Scots. Scotland benefited from French military aid, under the Auld Alliance. Edward VI continued the war until changing circumstances made it irrelevant in 1550. It was the last major conflict between Scotland and England before the Union of the Crowns in 1603, excepting perhaps the English intervention at the Siege of Leith in 1560, and was part of the Anglo-Scottish Wars of the 16th century.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Mary_Stuart_Young6.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_Wooing	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Hans_Eworth_Sir_John_Luttrell.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Facsimile_of_the_Hertford_sketch_of_1544.tiff", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Moubray_House_and_John_Knox%27s_House%2C_High_Street_Edinburgh.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Mary_Stuart_Young6.jpg"]	f	60%
77	John Knox	John Knox (c. 1514 – 24 November 1572) was a Scottish clergyman and a leader of the Protestant Reformation who is considered the founder of the Presbyterian denomination in Scotland. He is believed to have been educated at the University of St Andrews and worked as a notary-priest. Influenced by early church reformers such as George Wishart, he joined the movement to reform the Scottish church. He was caught up in the ecclesiastical and political events that involved the murder of Cardinal Beaton in 1546 and the intervention of the regent of Scotland Mary of Guise. He was taken prisoner by French forces the following year and exiled to England on his release in 1549.\nWhile in exile, Knox was licensed to work in the Church of England, where he rose in the ranks to serve King Edward VI of England as a royal chaplain. He exerted a reforming influence on the text of the Book of Common Prayer. In England he met and married his first wife Margery Bowes. When Mary Tudor ascended the throne and re-established Roman Catholicism, Knox was forced to resign his position and leave the country. Knox moved to Geneva and then to Frankfurt. In Geneva he met John Calvin, from whom he gained experience and knowledge of Reformed theology and Presbyterian polity. He created a new order of service, which was eventually adopted by the reformed church in Scotland. He left Geneva to head the English refugee church in Frankfurt but he was forced to leave over differences concerning the liturgy, thus ending his association with the Church of England.\nOn his return to Scotland he led the Protestant Reformation in Scotland, in partnership with the Scottish Protestant nobility. The movement may be seen as a revolution, since it led to the ousting of Mary of Guise, who governed the country in the name of her young daughter Mary, Queen of Scots. Knox helped write the new confession of faith and the ecclesiastical order for the newly created reformed church, the Kirk. He continued to serve as the religious leader of the Protestants throughout Mary's reign. In several interviews with the Queen, Knox admonished her for supporting Catholic practices. When she was imprisoned for her alleged role in the murder of her husband Lord Darnley, and King James VI enthroned in her stead, he openly called for her execution. He continued to preach until his final days.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Knox_Dispensing_the_Sacrament_at_Calder_House.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Knox	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/KnoxMaryLongBeachCovenantPC.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/KnoxDetailRefWall.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/St_John%27s_Kirk%2C_Perth.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Knox_Dispensing_the_Sacrament_at_Calder_House.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/John_Knox%27s_House%2C_High_Street%2C_Edinburgh.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Grave_of_John_Knox%2C_Parliament_Square%2C_Edinburgh.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/John_Knox_statue%2C_Haddington.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/John_Knox_Church_in_Brighton.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Calvin.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/KnoxRefWall.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Firstblast.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Calvin_Auditory.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/St._Giles%27_Cathedral_front.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2e/Knoxbezaicones.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Knox%2C_John.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/John_Knox_statue%2C_St_Giles_Edinburgh.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Preaching_of_Knox_before_the_Lords_of_the_Congregation.jpg"]	f	cover
433	Iron Curtain	The Iron Curtain symbolized the ideological conflict and physical boundary dividing Europe into two separate areas from the end of World War II in 1945 until the end of the Cold War in 1991. The term symbolized efforts by the Soviet Union to block itself and its satellite states from open contact with the west and non-Soviet-controlled areas. On the east side of the Iron Curtain were the countries that were connected to or influenced by the Soviet Union. On either side of the Iron Curtain, states developed their own international economic and military alliances:\nMember countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance and the Warsaw Pact, with the Soviet Union as the leading state\nMember countries of the European Community and/or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and with the United States as the leading country\nPhysically, the Iron Curtain took the form of border defenses between the countries of Europe in the middle of the continent. The most notable border was marked by the Berlin Wall and its Checkpoint Charlie which served as a symbol of the Curtain as a whole.\nThe events that demolished the Iron Curtain started in discontent in Poland, and continued in Hungary, the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Romania. Romania was the only communist state in Europe to violently overthrow its totalitarian government.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Curtain	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c7/Iron_Curtain.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Iron_Curtain_-_Hungary.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Grensovergang-helmstedt-marienborn-paspoortcontrole-vrachtautos.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Iron_Curtain_map.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Iron_Curtain_as_described_by_Churchill.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Moedlareuth_Museum_2002b.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Iron_curtain_in_Czech_Republic_2007.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Sound-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Point_Alpha_Ostseite.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Curtain_germany.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Cold_War_Map_1959.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Grensovergang-helmstedt-marienborn-lichtmast-02.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/EasternBloc_BasicMembersOnly.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/1_K_zone.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-1990-0419-014%2C_Berlin%2C_Loch_in_Mauer%2C_Grenzsoldaten%2C_Wachturm.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Bakom_Rysslands_jarnrid_.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1e/EasternBloc_PostDissolution2008.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Grensovergang-helmstedt-marienborn-paspoortcontrole-personenautos-04.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Grensovergang-helmstedt-marienborn-lichtmast-commandotoren-brug.JPG"]	f	cover
216	Joshua Reynolds	Sir Joshua Reynolds PRA FRS FRSA (16 July 1723 – 23 February 1792) was an influential eighteenth-century English painter, specialising in portraits and promoting the "Grand Style" in painting which depended on idealization of the imperfect. He was one of the founders and first president of the Royal Academy, and was knighted by George III in 1769.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Joshua_Reynolds_Self_Portrait.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Reynolds	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Sir_Joshua_Reynolds_-_Colonel_Acland_and_Lord_Sydney-_The_Archers_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Sir_Joshua_Reynolds_-_Sarah_Campbell_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Sir_Joshua_Reynolds_-_The_Ladies_Waldegrave_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/George_Augustus_Eliott%2C_1st_Baron_Heathfield_-_by_Joshua_Reynolds_-_Project_Gutenberg_eText_19009.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Elizabeth%2C_Lady_Amherst_%281740-1830%29_by_Joshua_Reynolds.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Joshua_Reynolds_-_Lady_Elizabeth_Delm%C3%A9_and_her_Children_-_WGA19337.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Jane%2C_Countess_of_Harrington.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Joshua_Reynolds_by_Gilbert_Stuart_1784.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Joshua_Reynolds_Self_Portrait.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Mrs_Siddons_by_Joshua_Reynolds.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Joshua_Reynolds_by_Joshua_Reynolds.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Reynolds_Sir_Joshua-Lady_Caroline_Howard.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Reynolds.clive.750pix.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Augustus_Keppel_BHC2821.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Augustus_Keppel%2C_Viscount_Keppel_by_Sir_Joshua_Reynolds.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Charles_Lennox%2C_3rd_Duke_of_Richmond.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Captain_the_Honourable_Augustus_Keppel_1725-86_by_Sir_Joshua_Reynolds.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/.Fig_1_Sir_Joshua_Reynolds_The_Age_of_Innocence._Painted_circa_1788._Frame_contemporary_with_picture._From_Houghton%2C_2005%2C_24..jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Admiral_Hood_1783.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/2ndEarlofHalifaxByJoshuaReynoldsNSArtGallery.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/EdwardCornwallisArtGalleryofNovaScotia1756.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Colonel_George_K._H._Coussmaker%2C_Grenadier_Guards_by_Joshua_Reynolds_1782.jpeg"]	f	60%
234	United States Declaration of Independence	The Declaration of Independence is the usual name of a statement adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, which announced that the thirteen American colonies, then at war with Great Britain, regarded themselves as 13 newly independent sovereign states, and no longer a part of the British Empire. Instead they formed a new nation—the United States of America. John Adams was a leader in pushing for independence, which was unanimously approved on July 2. A committee had already drafted the formal declaration, to be ready when Congress voted on independence. The term "Declaration of Independence" is not used in the document itself.\nAdams persuaded the committee to select Thomas Jefferson to compose the original draft of the document, which congress would edit to produce the final version. The Declaration was ultimately a formal explanation of why Congress had voted on July 2 to declare independence from Great Britain, more than a year after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. The national birthday, the Independence Day is celebrated on July 4, although Adams wanted July 2.\nAfter ratifying the text on July 4, Congress issued the Declaration of Independence in several forms. It was initially published as the printed Dunlap broadside that was widely distributed and read to the public. The source copy used for this printing has been lost, and may have been a copy in Thomas Jefferson's hand.  Jefferson's original draft, complete with changes made by John Adams and Benjamin Franklin, and Jefferson's notes of changes made by Congress, is preserved at the Library of Congress. The most famous version of the Declaration, a signed copy that is popularly regarded as the official document, is displayed at the National Archives in Washington, D.C. This engrossed copy was ordered by Congress on July 19, and signed primarily on August 2. \nThe sources and interpretation of the Declaration have been the subject of much scholarly inquiry. The Declaration justified the independence of the United States by listing colonial grievances against King George III, and by asserting certain natural and legal rights, including a right of revolution. Having served its original purpose in announcing independence, references to the text of the Declaration were few for the next four score years. Abraham Lincoln made it the centerpiece of his rhetoric (as in the Gettysburg Address of 1863), and his policies. Since then, it has become a well-known statement on human rights, particularly its second sentence:\n\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\n\nThis has been called "one of the best-known sentences in the English language", containing "the most potent and consequential words in American history". The passage came to represent a moral standard to which the United States should strive. This view was notably promoted by Abraham Lincoln, who considered the Declaration to be the foundation of his political philosophy, and argued that the Declaration is a statement of principles through which the United States Constitution should be interpreted. It provided inspiration to numerous national declarations of independence throughout the world.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Declaration_independence.jpg/640px-Declaration_independence.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Us_declaration_independence.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Writing_the_Declaration_of_Independence_1776_cph.3g09904.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/USA_declaration_independence.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/JohnLocke.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/JohnHancocksSignature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Signing_of_Declaration_1869_Issue-24c.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Thomas_Jefferson_rev.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Sound-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence_Part_2.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/William_Whipple.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Declaration_independence.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Constitution_of_the_United_States%2C_page_1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Declaration_of_Independence_Part_1.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Declaration_House_Graff_House.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Independence_Hall_belltower.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Independence_Hall_Assembly_Room.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Abelincoln1846.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Articles_page1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/ArchivesRotunda.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Johannes_Adam_Simon_Oertel_Pulling_Down_the_Statue_of_King_George_III%2C_N.Y.C._ca._1859.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Jefferson%27s%2Bdesk.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/92/ElizabethCadyStanton-1848-Daniel-Henry.jpg"]	f	cover
500	Russia	Russia /ˈrʌʃə/ or /ˈrʊʃə/ (Russian: Россия, tr. Rossiya, IPA: [rɐˈsʲijə] ( )), also officially known as the Russian Federation (Russian: Российская Федерация, tr. Rossiyskaya Federatsiya, IPA: [rɐˈsʲijskəjə fʲɪdʲɪˈrat͡sɨjə] ( )), is a country situated in northern Eurasia. It is a federal semi-presidential republic, comprising eighty-five federal subjects (including the internationally disputed annexation of the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol City). From northwest to southeast, Russia shares land borders with Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland (both with Kaliningrad Oblast), Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia, and North Korea. It shares maritime borders with Japan by the Sea of Okhotsk, the U.S. state of Alaska across the Bering Strait and Canada's Arctic islands. At 17,075,400 square kilometres (6,592,800 sq mi), Russia is the largest country in the world, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area. Russia is also the world's ninth most populous nation with 143 million people as of 2012. Extending across the entirety of northern Asia and much of Eastern Europe, Russia spans nine time zones and incorporates a wide range of environments and landforms.\nThe nation's history began with that of the East Slavs, who emerged as a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants, the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century. In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire, beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium. Rus' ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states; most of the Rus' lands were overrun by the Mongol invasion and became tributaries of the nomadic Golden Horde. The Grand Duchy of Moscow gradually reunified the surrounding Russian principalities, achieved independence from the Golden Horde, and came to dominate the cultural and political legacy of Kievan Rus'. By the 18th century, the nation had greatly expanded through conquest, annexation, and exploration to become the Russian Empire, which was the third largest empire in history, stretching from Poland in Europe to Alaska in North America.\nFollowing the Russian Revolution, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic became the largest and leading constituent of the Soviet Union, the world's first constitutionally socialist state and a recognized superpower, which played a decisive role in the Allied victory in World War II. The Soviet era saw some of the most significant technological achievements of the 20th century, including the world's first spacecraft, and the first man in space. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Russian SFSR reconstituted itself as the Russian Federation and is recognized as the continuing legal personality of the Union state.\nThe Russian economy ranks as the eighth largest by nominal GDP and fifth largest by purchasing power parity. Russia's extensive mineral and energy resources, the largest reserves in the world, have made it one of the largest producers of oil and natural gas globally. The country is one of the five recognized nuclear weapons states and possesses the largest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. Russia is a great power and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, a member of the G20, the Council of Europe, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the Eurasian Economic Community, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and the leading member of the Commonwealth of Independent States.\n\n	\N	\N	\N	http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KcbzC7epZrE/Tjf9Qs1UI6I/AAAAAAAAE7E/ncHJgisQRZ8/s1600/russia.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg",

501	Germany	Germany (/ˈdʒɜrməni/; German: Deutschland), officially the Federal Republic of Germany (German: Bundesrepublik Deutschland, pronounced [ˈbʊndəsʁepuˌbliːk ˈdɔʏtʃlant] ( )), is a federal parliamentary republic in western-central Europe. The country consists of 16 states and its capital and largest city is Berlin. Germany covers an area of 357,021 square kilometres (137,847 sq mi) and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With 80.6 million inhabitants, it is the most populous member state in the European Union. Germany is the major economic and political power of the European continent and a historic leader in many cultural, theoretical and technical fields.\nVarious Germanic tribes occupied what is now northern Germany and southern Scandinavia since classical antiquity. A region named Germania was documented by the Romans before AD 100. During the Migration Period that coincided with the decline of the Roman Empire, the Germanic tribes expanded southward and established kingdoms throughout much of Europe. Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation. Occupied during the Napoleonic Wars, the rise of Pan-Germanism inside the German Confederation resulted in the unification of most of the German states in 1871 into the German Empire, which was dominated by Prussia.\nAfter the German Revolution of 1918–1919 and the subsequent military surrender in World War I, the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary Weimar Republic in 1918, with some of its territory partitioned in the Treaty of Versailles. Despite its lead in many scientific and cultural fields at this time, Germany nonetheless endured significant economic and political instability, which intensified during the Great Depression and contributed to the establishment of the Third Reich in 1933. The subsequent rise of fascism led to World War II. After 1945, Germany was divided by allied occupation, and evolved into two states, East Germany and West Germany. In 1990, the country was reunified.\nGermany has the world's fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the fifth-largest by purchasing power parity. As a global leader in several industrial and technological sectors, it is the second-largest exporter and third-largest importer of goods. It is a developed country with a very high standard of living, featuring comprehensive social security that includes the world's oldest universal health care system. Known for its rich cultural and political history, Germany has been the home of many influential philosophers, music composers, scientists, and inventors. Germany was a founding member of the European Community in 1957, which became the EU in 1993. It is part of the Schengen Area, and has been a member of the eurozone since 1999. Germany is a great power in regional and global affairs, and is a member of the United Nations, NATO, the G8, the G20, the OECD and the Council of Europe.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg",

54	Catherine de' Medici	Catherine de' Medici (Italian: Caterina de' Medici pronounced [kateˈriːna de ˈmɛːditʃi], 13 April 1519 – 5 January 1589), daughter of Lorenzo II de' Medici and of Madeleine de La Tour d'Auvergne, was an Italian noblewoman who was Queen of France from 1547 until 1559, as the wife of King Henry II. As the mother of three sons who became kings of France during her lifetime she had extensive, if at times varying, influence in the political life of France. For a time she ruled France as its regent.\nIn 1533, at the age of fourteen, Caterina married Henry, second son of King Francis I and Queen Claude of France. Under the gallicised version of her name, Catherine de Médicis, she was Queen consort of France as the wife of King Henry II of France from 1547 to 1559. Throughout his reign, Henry excluded Catherine from participating in state affairs and instead showered favours on his chief mistress, Diane de Poitiers, who wielded much influence over him. Henry's death thrust Catherine into the political arena as mother of the frail fifteen-year-old King Francis II. When he died in 1560, she became regent on behalf of her ten-year-old son King Charles IX and was granted sweeping powers. After Charles died in 1574, Catherine played a key role in the reign of her third son, Henry III. He dispensed with her advice only in the last months of her life.\nCatherine's three sons reigned in an age of almost constant civil and religious war in France. The problems facing the monarchy were complex and daunting. At first, Catherine compromised and made concessions to the rebelling Protestants, or Huguenots, as they became known. She failed, however, to grasp the theological issues that drove their movement. Later, she resorted in frustration and anger to hard-line policies against them. In return, she came to be blamed for the excessive persecutions carried out under her sons' rule, in particular for the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572, in which thousands of Huguenots were killed in Paris and throughout France.\nSome historians have excused Catherine from blame for the worst decisions of the crown, though evidence for her ruthlessness can be found in her letters. In practice, her authority was always limited by the effects of the civil wars. Her policies, therefore, may be seen as desperate measures to keep the Valois monarchy on the throne at all costs, and her patronage of the arts as an attempt to glorify a monarchy whose prestige was in steep decline. Without Catherine, it is unlikely that her sons would have remained in power. The years in which they reigned have been called "the age of Catherine de' Medici". According to one of her biographers Mark Strage, Catherine was the most powerful woman in sixteenth-century Europe.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_de%27_Medici	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Catherine_de_Medicis.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Henri_%26_Catherine.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/FrancoisII.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Henry_II%2C_king_of_France.._F_Clouet.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Henry%2C_third_duke_of_Guise.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Jeton_en_argent_sur_Catherine_de_M%C3%A9dicis.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Jeanne-albret-navarre.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Nicholas_Hilliard_002.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/KatharinavonMedici.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Noc_%C5%9Bw._Bart%C5%82omieja.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Caron-Antoine-triumph-of-winter.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/COA_french_queen_Catherine_de_M%C3%A9dicis.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Catherine_de_Medicis_Henri_II_gisants_basilique-Saint-Denis.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Catherine-de-medici.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Anjou_1570louvre.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Brazilian_ball_for_Henry_II_in_Rouen_October_1_1550.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Ballet_1582.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Clement_VII._Sebastiano_del_Piombo._c.1531..jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Charles_IX_of_France_by_F._Clouet.jpg"]	f	cover
498	Colonialism	Colonialism is the establishment, exploitation, maintenance, acquisition, and expansion of colonies in one territory by people from another territory. It is a set of unequal relationships between the colonial power and the colony and often between the colonists and the indigenous population.\nThe European colonial period was the era from the 16th century to the mid-20th century when several European powers (particularly, but not exclusively, Portugal, Spain, Britain, the Netherlands, Italy and France) established colonies in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. At first the countries followed mercantilist policies designed to strengthen the home economy at the expense of rivals, so the colonies were usually allowed to trade only with the mother country. By the mid-19th century, however, the powerful British Empire gave up mercantilism and trade restrictions and introduced the principle of free trade, with few restrictions or tariffs.	\N	\N	\N	http://passivevoices.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/colonialism-1.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg",

29	Titian	Tiziano Vecelli or Tiziano Vecellio (c. 1488/1490 – 27 August 1576) known in English as Titian /ˈtɪʃən/ was an Italian painter, the most important member of the 16th-century Venetian school. He was born in Pieve di Cadore, near Belluno (in Veneto), in the Republic of Venice. During his lifetime he was often called da Cadore, taken from the place of his birth.\nRecognized by his contemporaries as "The Sun Amidst Small Stars" (recalling the famous final line of Dante's Paradiso), Titian was one of the most versatile of Italian painters, equally adept with portraits, landscape backgrounds, and mythological and religious subjects. His painting methods, particularly in the application and use of color, would exercise a profound influence not only on painters of the Italian Renaissance, but on future generations of Western art.\nDuring the course of his long life, Titian's artistic manner changed drastically but he retained a lifelong interest in color. Although his mature works may not contain the vivid, luminous tints of his early pieces, their loose brushwork and subtlety of tone are without precedent in the history of Western art.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titian	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Tizian_085.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/62/PD-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Tizian_078.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Titian-salome.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/TItian_-_The_Flaying_of_Marsyas.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Tizian_011.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Titian_-_Allegorie_der_Zeit.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/0_Portrait_d%27une_femme_%C3%A0_sa_toilette_-_Titien_-_Louvre_%28INV_755%29_-_%282%29.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Tizian_090.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Carlos_V_en_M%C3%BChlberg%2C_by_Titian%2C_from_Prado_in_Google_Earth.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Actaeon.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Tizian_053.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Tizian_041.jpg"]	f	cover
71	Elizabethan era	The Elizabethan era was the epoch in English history of Queen Elizabeth I's reign (1558–1603). Historians often depict it as the golden age in English history. The symbol of Britannia was first used in 1572 and often thereafter to mark the Elizabethan age as a renaissance that inspired national pride through classical ideals, international expansion, and naval triumph over the hated Spanish foe. In terms of the entire century, the historian John Guy (1988) argues that "England was economically healthier, more expansive, and more optimistic under the Tudors" than at any time in a thousand years.\nThis "golden age" represented the apogee of the English Renaissance and saw the flowering of poetry, music and literature. The era is most famous for theatre, as William Shakespeare and many others composed plays that broke free of England's past style of theatre. It was an age of exploration and expansion abroad, while back at home, the Protestant Reformation became more acceptable to the people, most certainly after the Spanish Armada was repulsed. It was also the end of the period when England was a separate realm before its royal union with Scotland.\nThe Elizabethan Age is viewed so highly largely because of the periods before and after. It was a brief period of largely internal peace between the English Reformation and the battles between Protestants and Catholics and the battles between parliament and the monarchy that engulfed the seventeenth century. The Protestant/Catholic divide was settled, for a time, by the Elizabethan Religious Settlement, and parliament was not yet strong enough to challenge royal absolutism.\nEngland was also well-off compared to the other nations of Europe. The Italian Renaissance had come to an end under the weight of foreign domination of the peninsula. France was embroiled in its own religious battles that would only be settled in 1598 with the Edict of Nantes. In part because of this, but also because the English had been expelled from their last outposts on the continent, the centuries long conflict between France and England was largely suspended for most of Elizabeth's reign.\nThe one great rival was Spain, with which England clashed both in Europe and the Americas in skirmishes that exploded into the Anglo-Spanish War of 1585–1604. An attempt by Philip II of Spain to invade England with the Spanish Armada in 1588 was famously defeated, but the tide of war turned against England with an unsuccessful expedition to Portugal and the Azores, the Drake-Norris Expedition of 1589. Thereafter Spain provided some support for Irish Catholics in a debilitating rebellion against English rule, and Spanish naval and land forces inflicted a series of reversals against English offensives. This drained both the English Exchequer and economy that had been so carefully restored under Elizabeth's prudent guidance. English commercial and territorial expansion would be limited until the signing of the Treaty of London the year following Elizabeth's death.\nEngland during this period had a centralised, well-organised, and effective government, largely a result of the reforms of Henry VII and Henry VIII. Economically, the country began to benefit greatly from the new era of trans-Atlantic trade.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/British_-_Francis_Bacon_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabethan_era	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9e/Elizabeth_succession_allegory.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Elizabeth_I%2C_Procession_Portrait..jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Coat_of_Arms_of_England_%281558-1603%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Joris_Hoefnagel_Fete_at_Bermondsey_c_1569.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Invincible_Armada.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/1590_or_later_Marcus_Gheeraerts%2C_Sir_Francis_Drake_Buckland_Abbey%2C_Devon.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Darnley_stage_3.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/British_-_Francis_Bacon_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Britannia-Statue.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/be/Flag_of_England.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Southwark_reconstructed_globe.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Magna_charta_cum_statutis_angliae_p1.jpg"]	f	cover
79	Christopher Marlowe	Christopher Marlowe (baptised 26 February 1564 – 30 May 1593) was an English dramatist, poet and translator of the Elizabethan era. Marlowe was the foremost Elizabethan tragedian of his day. He greatly influenced William Shakespeare, who was born in the same year as Marlowe and who rose to become the pre-eminent Elizabethan playwright after Marlowe's mysterious early death. Marlowe's plays are known for the use of blank verse, and their overreaching protagonists.\nA warrant was issued for Marlowe's arrest on 18 May 1593. No reason was given for it, though it was thought to be connected to allegations of blasphemy—a manuscript believed to have been written by Marlowe was said to contain "vile heretical conceipts". On 20 May he was brought to the court to attend upon the Privy Council for questioning. There is no record of their having met that day, however, and he was commanded to attend upon them each day thereafter until "licensed to the contrary." Ten days later, he was stabbed to death by Ingram Frizer. Whether the stabbing was connected to his arrest has never been resolved.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Portrait_of_Christopher_Marlowe.png	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Marlowe	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/WPA_poster_Christopher_Marlowe_Faustus.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Marlowe-Portrait-1585.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Handwriting-Marlowe-Massacre-1.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/OldCurtCC.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Marlowe.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Canterbury_-_Turm_der_St._George%27s_Church%2C_in_der_Marlowe_getauft_wurde.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Edward2a.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Christopher_Marlowe_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/ShakespeareCandidates1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Portrait_of_Christopher_Marlowe.png"]	f	contain
369	Expressionism	Expressionism was a modernist movement, initially in poetry and painting, originating in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century. Its typical trait is to present the world solely from a subjective perspective, distorting it radically for emotional effect in order to evoke moods or ideas. Expressionist artists sought to express meaning or emotional experience rather than physical reality.\nExpressionism was developed as an avant-garde style before the First World War. It remained popular during the Weimar Republic, particularly in Berlin. The style extended to a wide range of the arts, including expressionist architecture, painting, literature, theatre, dance, film and music.\nThe term is sometimes suggestive of angst. In a general sense, painters such as Matthias Grünewald and El Greco are sometimes termed expressionist, though in practice the term is applied mainly to 20th-century works.

80	William Shakespeare	William Shakespeare (/ˈʃeɪkspɪər/; 26 April 1564 (baptised) – 23 April 1616) was an English poet, playwright and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon". His extant works, including some collaborations, consist of about 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, the authorship of some of which is uncertain. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.\nShakespeare was born and brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613 at age 49, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive, and there has been considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, sexuality, religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.\nShakespeare produced most of his known work between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were mainly comedies and histories, genres he raised to the peak of sophistication and artistry by the end of the 16th century. He then wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608, including Hamlet, King Lear, Othello, and Macbeth, considered some of the finest works in the English language. In his last phase, he wrote tragicomedies, also known as romances, and collaborated with other playwrights.\nMany of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. In 1623, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two friends and fellow actors of Shakespeare, published the First Folio, a collected edition of his dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare's. It was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which Shakespeare is hailed, presciently, as "not of an age, but for all time."\nShakespeare was a respected poet and playwright in his own day, but his reputation did not rise to its present heights until the 19th century. The Romantics, in particular, acclaimed Shakespeare's genius, and the Victorians worshipped Shakespeare with a reverence that George Bernard Shaw called "bardolatry". In the 20th century, his work was repeatedly adopted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance. His plays remain highly popular today and are constantly studied, performed, and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/R_Staines_Malvolio_Shakespeare_Twelfth_Night.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/John_Opie_-_Winter%27s_Tale%2C_Act_II._Scene_III.jpg",

84	Thirty Years' War	The Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) was a series of wars principally fought in Central Europe, involving most of the countries of Europe. It was one of the most destructive conflicts in European history, and one of the longest continuous wars in modern history.\nInitially, religion was a motivation for war as Protestant and Catholic states battled it out even though they all were inside the Holy Roman Empire. Changing the relative balance of power within the Empire was at issue. Gradually, it developed into a more general conflict involving most of the great powers of Europe. In this general phase, the war became less specifically religious and more a continuation of the Bourbon–Habsburg rivalry for European political pre-eminence, leading in turn to further warfare between France and the Habsburg powers.\nA major consequence of the Thirty Years' War was the devastation of entire regions, denuded by the foraging armies (bellum se ipsum alet). Famine and disease significantly decreased the population of the German states, Bohemia, the Low Countries, and Italy; most of the combatant powers were bankrupted. While the regiments within each army were not strictly mercenary, in that they were not units for hire that changed sides from battle to battle, some individual soldiers that made up the regiments were mercenaries. The problem of discipline was made more difficult by the ad hoc nature of 17th-century military financing; armies were expected to be largely self-funding by means of loot taken or tribute extorted from the settlements where they operated. This encouraged a form of lawlessness that imposed severe hardship on inhabitants of the occupied territory.\nThe Thirty Years' War was ended with the treaties of Osnabrück and Münster, part of the wider Peace of Westphalia. Some of the quarrels that provoked the war went unresolved for a much longer time.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Bautzen-nach1620-Merian.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Years%27_War	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Leonardo-socorro_de_brisach.jpg",

88	Louis XIII of France	Louis XIII (27 September 1601 – 14 May 1643) was a monarch of the House of Bourbon who ruled as King of France from 1610 to 1643 and King of Navarre (as Louis II) from 1610 to 1620, when the crown of Navarre was merged to the French crown.\nLouis succeeded his father Henry IV as king of France and Navarre a few months before his ninth birthday. His mother, Marie de' Medici, acted as regent during Louis's minority. Mismanagement of the kingdom and ceaseless political intrigues by Marie de' Medici and her Italian favourites led the young king to take power in 1617 by exiling his mother and executing her followers, including Concino Concini, the most influential Italian at the French court.\nLouis XIII, taciturn and suspicious, relied heavily on his chief minister Cardinal Richelieu to govern the kingdom of France. They are remembered for the establishment of the Académie française and for putting an end to the revolt of the French nobility. The reign of Louis "the Just" was also marked by the struggles against Huguenots and Habsburg Spain.\nFrance's greatest victory in the conflicts against the Habsburg Empire during the period 1635-59 came at the Battle of Rocroi (1643), five days after Louis's death from apparent complications of intestinal tuberculosis. This battle marked the end of Spain's military ascendancy in Europe and foreshadowed French dominance in Europe under Louis XIV, his son and successor.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Louis_XIII.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIII_of_France	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Luynes.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Louis_XIII_Richelieu_devant_La_Rochelle.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Fleet_of_Montmorency_led_by_Augustin_de_Beaulieu_1619_1622.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Ecu_d%27argent_de_Louis_XIII_le_Juste.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/LouisXIII.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Grand_Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/0_Louis_XIII_en_costume_de_deuil_-_Frans_Pourbus_le_Jeune_%282%29.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Royal_Standard_of_the_Kingdom_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Coat_of_Arms_of_the_Kingdom_of_Navarre.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Coat_of_Arms_of_the_Dauphin_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Louis_XIII_%28van_Egmont%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Louis_XIII.jpg"]	f	contain
499	Independence	Independence is a condition of a nation, country, or state in which its residents and population, or some portion thereof, exercise self-government, and usually sovereignty, over the territory. The opposite of independence is a dependent territory. Independence mean freedom.\nWhether the attainment of independence is different from revolution has long been contested, and has often been debated over the question of violence as a legitimate means to achieving sovereignty. While some revolutions seek and achieve national independence, others aim only to redistribute power — with or without an element of emancipation, such as in democratization — within a state, which as such may remain unaltered. Nation-states have been granted independence without any revolutionary acts.[citation needed] The Russian October Revolution, for example, was not intended to seek national independence (though it merely transformed government for much of the former Russian Empire, it did result in independence for Finland and Poland). However, the American Revolutionary War was intended to achieve independence from the beginning.\nAutonomy refers to a kind of independence which has been granted by an overseeing authority that itself still retains ultimate authority over that territory (see Devolution). A protectorate refers to an autonomous region that depends upon a larger government for its protection as an autonomous region. The dates of established independence (or, less commonly, the commencement of revolution), are typically celebrated as a national holiday known as an independence day.\nSometimes, a state wishing to achieve independence from a dominating power will issue a declaration of independence; the earliest surviving example is Scotland's Declaration of Arbroath in 1320, with the most recent example being Azawad's declaration of independence in 2012. Declaring independence and attaining it however, are quite different. A well-known successful example is the U.S. Declaration of Independence issued in 1776.\nHistorically, there have been three major periods of declaring independence: the years from 1776 to the Revolutions of 1848 in Europe; the immediate aftermath of the First World War with the breakup of the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian empires; and the decades from to 1945 to 1979, when seventy newly independent states emerged from the European colonial empires.\nCauses for a country or province wishing to seek independence are many. Disillusionment rising from the establishment is a cause widely used in separatist movements, but it is usually severe economic difficulties or nationalism that trigger these groups into action.[citation needed] The means can extend from peaceful demonstrations, like in the case of the Indian independence movement, to a violent civil war.	\N	\N	\N	http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aUjS5TbO9Ok/T-8KXNq_D8I/AAAAAAAAACY/OwwBgJLSgAk/s1600/Declaration%2Bof%2BIndependence.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg"]	f	cover
233	Thomas Paine	Thomas Paine (February 9, 1737 [O.S. January 29, 1736] – June 8, 1809) was an English-American political activist, author, political theorist and revolutionary. As the author of two highly influential pamphlets at the start of the American Revolution, he inspired the Patriots in 1776 to declare independence from Britain. His ideas reflected Enlightenment-era rhetoric of transnational human rights. He has been called "a corsetmaker by trade, a journalist by profession, and a propagandist by inclination".\nBorn in Thetford, England, in the county of Norfolk, Paine emigrated to the British American colonies in 1774 with the help of Benjamin Franklin, arriving just in time to participate in the American Revolution. His principal contributions were the powerful, widely-read pamphlet Common Sense (1776) that advocated colonial America's independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and The American Crisis (1776–83), a pro-revolutionary pamphlet series. Common Sense was so influential that John Adams said, "Without the pen of the author of Common Sense, the sword of Washington would have been raised in vain."\nPaine lived in France for most of the 1790s, becoming deeply involved in the French Revolution. He wrote the Rights of Man (1791), in part a defence of the French Revolution against its critics. His attacks on British writer Edmund Burke led to a trial and conviction in absentia in 1792 for the crime of seditious libel. In 1792, despite not being able to speak French, he was elected to the French National Convention. The Girondists regarded him as an ally. Consequently, the Montagnards, especially Robespierre, regarded him as an enemy.\nIn December 1793, he was arrested and imprisoned in Paris, then released in 1794. He became notorious because of his pamphlet The Age of Reason (1793–94), in which he advocated deism, promoted reason and freethinking, and argued against institutionalized religion in general and Christian doctrine in particular. He also wrote the pamphlet Agrarian Justice (1795), discussing the origins of property, and introduced the concept of a guaranteed minimum income. In 1802, he returned to America where he died on June 8, 1809. Only six people attended his funeral as he had been ostracized for his ridicule of Christianity.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Thomas_Paine_by_Matthew_Pratt,_1785-95.jpg/220px-Thomas_Paine_by_Matthew_Pratt,_1785-95.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Paine	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/26/Thomas_Paine_Plaque_NY.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Thomas_Paine_rev1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Thomas_Paines_Lewes_home.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/White_Hart_Paine_plaque.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Plaque_Thomas_Paine%2C_10_rue_de_l%27Od%C3%A9on%2C_Paris_6.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/PaineAgeReason.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Statue_of_Thomas_Paine%2C_Thetford%2C_Norfolk.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Prinsenvlag.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Thomas_Paine.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/ThomasPaineStamp1969.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Thomas_Paine_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Thomas_Paine_Commemorative_Plaque_-_geograph.org.uk_-_311958.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Thomas_Paine_by_Matthew_Pratt%2C_1785-95.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Thomas_Paine_by_Laurent_Dabos-crop.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Flag_of_Prussia_1892-1918.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Fashion-before-Ease-Gillray.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Flag_of_Spain_%281785-1873_and_1875-1931%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/01_Thomas_Paine.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Commonsense.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/BHS-TP_Statue.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Old_School_at_Thetford_Grammar.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Friends_of_the_People_1792_Cruikshank.jpg"]	f	70%
403	New Deal	The New Deal was a series of domestic programs enacted in the United States between 1933 and 1938. They involved laws passed by Congress as well as presidential executive orders during the first term of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The programs were in response to the Great Depression, and focused on what historians call the "3 Rs": Relief, Recovery, and Reform. That is Relief for the unemployed and poor; Recovery of the economy to normal levels; and Reform of the financial system to prevent a repeat depression.\nThe New Deal produced a political realignment, making the Democratic Party the majority (as well as the party that held the White House for seven out of nine Presidential terms from 1933 to 1969), with its base in liberal ideas, the white South, traditional Democrats, big city machines, and the newly empowered labor unions and ethnic minorities. The Republicans were split, with conservatives opposing the entire New Deal as an enemy of business and growth, and liberals accepting some of it and promising to make it more efficient. The realignment crystallized into the New Deal Coalition that dominated most presidential elections into the 1960s, while the opposition Conservative Coalition largely controlled Congress from 1937 to 1963. By 1936 the term "liberal" typically was used for supporters of the New Deal, and "conservative" for its opponents. From 1934 to 1938, Roosevelt was assisted in his endeavours by a "pro-spender" majority in Congress (drawn from two-party, competitive, non-machine, Progressive, and Left party districts). As noted by Alexander Hicks, "Roosevelt, backed by rare, non-Southern Democrat majorities—270 non-Southern Democrat representatives and 71 non-Southern Democrat senators—spelled Second New Deal reform."\nMany historians distinguish between a "First New Deal" (1933–34) and a "Second New Deal" (1935–38), with the second one more liberal and more controversial. The "First New Deal" (1933–34) dealt with diverse groups, from banking and railroads to industry and farming, all of which demanded help for economic survival. The Federal Emergency Relief Administration, for instance, provided $500 million for relief operations by states and cities, while the short-lived CWA (Civil Works Administration) gave localities money to operate make-work projects in 1933-34.\nThe "Second New Deal" in 1935–38 included the Wagner Act to promote labor unions, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) relief program (which made the federal government by far the largest single employer in the nation), the Social Security Act, and new programs to aid tenant farmers and migrant workers. The final major items of New Deal legislation were the creation of the United States Housing Authority and Farm Security Administration, both in 1937, and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which set maximum hours and minimum wages for most categories of workers.\nThe economic downturn of 1937–38, and the bitter split between the AFL and CIO labor unions led to major Republican gains in Congress in 1938. Conservative Republicans and Democrats in Congress joined in the informal Conservative Coalition. By 1942–43 they shut down relief programs such as the WPA and CCC and blocked major liberal proposals. Roosevelt himself turned his attention to the war effort, and won reelection in 1940 and 1944. The Supreme Court declared the National Recovery Administration (NRA) and the first version of the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) unconstitutional, however the AAA was rewritten and then upheld. As the first Republican president elected after FDR, Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953–61) left the New Deal largely intact, even expanding it in some areas. In the 1960s, Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society used the New Deal as inspiration for a dramatic expansion of liberal programs, which Republican Richard M. Nixon generally retained. After 1974, however, the call for deregulation of the economy gained bipartisan support. The New Deal regulation of banking (Glass–Steagall Act) was suspended in the 1990s. Many New Deal programs remain active, with some still operating under the original names, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC), the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). The largest programs still in existence today are the Social Security System and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/TVA_water_supply_Wilder.gif	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/15/Franklin-roosevelt.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/William_Gropper_-_Construction_of_a_Dam_1939.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Women_working_at_Douglas_Aircraft.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Wpa1.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/US_GDP_10-60.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/US_Manufacturing_Employment_Graph_-_1920_to_1940.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/US_Unemployment_1910-1960.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/WPAAdultEducation.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/NewDealNRA.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/NewDeal.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Office-book.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/New_York_City_municipal_airports%2C_WPA_poster%2C_ca._1937.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/SocialSecurityposter1.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Public_Works_Administration_Project%2C_U.S._Army_Corps_of_Engineers%2C_Bonneville_Power_and_Navigation_Dam_in_Oregon..._-_NARA_-_195806.tif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/TVA_water_supply_Wilder.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Surplus_Foods_Are_Quality_Foods.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/US_Employment_Graph_-_1920_to_1940.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/This_farmer_is_not_on_government_relief.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Fireside_Chat_1_On_the_Banking_Crisis_%28March_12%2C_1933%29_Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/FERA%2C_Camps_for_Unemployed_Women%2C_Maine_-_NARA_-_196588.tif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/FDR-LBJ.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Federal_Theater_Project_Created_Equal.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Federal_Emergency_Relief_Administration%2C_FERA_camps_for_unemployed_women._Negro_camp_in_Atlanta%2C_GA_-_NARA_-_196584.tif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/American_union_bank.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/DrawingWater.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Debt1929-50.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/National_Labor_Relations_Act2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Gdp20-40.jpg"]	f	cover
319	José de San Martín	José Francisco de San Martín (25 February 1778 – 17 August 1850), known simply as José de San Martín (Spanish pronunciation: [xoˈse ðe san marˈtin]), was an Argentine general and the prime leader of the southern part of South America's successful struggle for independence from the Spanish Empire. Born in Yapeyú, Corrientes, in modern Argentina, he left his mother country at the early age of seven to study in Málaga, Spain.\nIn 1808, after taking part in the Peninsular War against France, San Martín contacted South American supporters of independence from Spain. In 1812, he set sail for Buenos Aires and offered his services to the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata, present-day Argentina. After the Battle of San Lorenzo and time commanding the Army of the North during 1814, he organized a plan to defeat the Spanish forces that menaced the United Provinces from the north, using an alternative path to the Viceroyalty of Peru. This objective first involved the establishment of a new army, the Army of the Andes, in Cuyo Province, Argentina. From there, he led the Crossing of the Andes to Chile, and triumphed at the Battle of Chacabuco and the Battle of Maipú (1818), thus liberating Chile from royalist rule. Then he sailed to attack the Spanish stronghold of Lima, Peru.\nOn 12 July 1821, after seizing partial control of Lima, San Martín was appointed Protector of Peru, and Peruvian independence was officially declared on 28 July. On 22 July 1822, after a closed-door meeting with fellow libertador Simón Bolívar at Guayaquil, Ecuador, Bolívar took over the task of fully liberating Peru. San Martín unexpectedly left the country and resigned the command of his army, excluding himself from politics and the military, and moved to France in 1824. The details of the 22 July meeting would be a subject of debate by later historians.\nSan Martín is regarded as a national hero of Argentina and Peru, and, together with Bolívar, one of the liberators of Spanish South America. The Order of the Liberator General San Martín (Orden del Libertador General San Martín), created in his honor, is the highest decoration conferred by the Argentine government.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Ejercito_de_los_Andes.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_de_San_Mart%C3%ADn	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/db/Fragata_George_Canning.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/75/Cabral%2C_soldado_heroico.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/San_Mart%C3%ADn_en_Buenos_Aires.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Smartin.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Ohiggins.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Red_versus_blue_swords.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Revista_de_Rancagua_Blanes.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/SanMartinMausoleum.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/La_Rendici%C3%B3n_de_Bail%C3%A9n_%28Casado_del_Alisal%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Mendoza_-_Cerro_de_la_Gloria_-_Monumento.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Monument_of_Jose_de_San_Martin_in_Sofia%2C_Bulgaria.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Jose_de_San_Martin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Flag_of_Argentina_%28alternative%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Flag_of_Argentina.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Flag_of_Peru.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Flag_of_Chile.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Flag_of_Spain_%281785-1873_and_1875-1931%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Flag_of_Peru_%281821_-_1822%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Josedesanmartin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Gran_Sello_de_la_Rep%C3%BAblica_del_Per%C3%BA.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/La_Independencia_del_Per%C3%BA.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/JuraIndependencia.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Belgrano_y_San_Mart%C3%ADn.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/%D4%B3%D5%A5%D5%B6%D5%A5%D6%80%D5%A1%D5%AC_%D4%BD%D5%B8%D5%BD%D5%A5_%D5%A4%D5%A5_%D5%8D%D5%A1%D5%B6_%D5%84%D5%A1%D6%80%D5%BF%D5%AB%D5%B61.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Ejercito_Libertador_cruce_de_Cordillera_de_los_andes.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Desembarco_en_Pisco.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/El_Batall%C3%B3n_Numancia_recibe_la_Bandera_del_Ej%C3%A9rcito_Libertador.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Ejercito_de_los_Andes.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Abrazo_de_Maip%C3%BA_Pedro_Subercaseaux.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Battle_of_Chacabuco.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/BANDERA_PATRIA_NUEVA_O_TRANSICION.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Firma_Jos%C3%A9_de_San_Mart%C3%ADn.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Entrevista_de_Guayaquil.jpg"]	f	cover
106	Glorious Revolution	The Glorious Revolution, also called the Revolution of 1688, was the overthrow of King James II of England (James VII of Scotland and James II of Ireland) by a union of English Parliamentarians with the Dutch stadtholder William III of Orange-Nassau (William of Orange). William's successful invasion of England with a Dutch fleet and army led to his ascending of the English throne as William III of England jointly with his wife Mary II of England.\nKing James's policies of religious tolerance after 1685 met with increasing opposition by members of leading political circles, who were troubled by the king's Catholicism and his close ties with France. The crisis facing the king came to a head in 1688, with the birth of the King's son, James Francis Edward Stuart, on 10 June (Julian calendar). This changed the existing line of succession by displacing the heir presumptive, his daughter Mary, a Protestant and the wife of William of Orange, with young James as heir apparent. The establishment of a Roman Catholic dynasty in the kingdoms now seemed likely. Some of the most influential leaders of the Tories united with members of the opposition Whigs and set out to resolve the crisis by inviting William of Orange to England, which the stadtholder, who feared an Anglo-French alliance, had indicated as a condition for a military intervention.\nAfter consolidating political and financial support, William crossed the North Sea and English Channel with a large invasion fleet in November 1688, landing at Torbay. After only two minor clashes between the two opposing armies in England, and anti-Catholic riots in several towns, James's regime collapsed, largely because of a lack of resolve shown by the king. However, this was followed by the protracted Williamite War in Ireland and Dundee's rising in Scotland. In England's geographically-distant American colonies, the revolution led to the collapse of the Dominion of New England and the overthrow of the Province of Maryland's government. Following a defeat of his forces at the Battle of Reading on 9 December, James and his wife fled England; James, however, returned to London for a two-week period that culminated in his final departure for France on 23 December. By threatening to withdraw his troops, William in February 1689 convinced a newly chosen Convention Parliament to make him and his wife joint monarchs.\nThe Revolution permanently ended any chance of Catholicism becoming re-established in England. For British Catholics its effects were disastrous both socially and politically: Catholics were denied the right to vote and sit in the Westminster Parliament for over a century; they were also denied commissions in the army, and the monarch was forbidden to be Catholic or to marry a Catholic, this latter prohibition remaining in force until the UK's Succession to the Crown Act 2013 removes it once it comes into effect. The Revolution led to limited toleration for Nonconformist Protestants, although it would be some time before they had full political rights. It has been argued, mainly by Whig historians, that James's overthrow began modern English parliamentary democracy: the Bill of Rights of 1689 has become one of the most important documents in the political history of Britain and never since has the monarch held absolute power.\nInternationally, the Revolution was related to the War of the Grand Alliance on mainland Europe. It has been seen as the last successful invasion of England. It ended all attempts by England in the Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th century to subdue the Dutch Republic by military force. However, the resulting economic integration and military co-operation between the English and Dutch navies shifted the dominance in world trade from the Dutch Republic to England and later to Great Britain.\nThe expression "Glorious Revolution" was first used by John Hampden in late 1689, and is an expression that is still used by the British Parliament. The Glorious Revolution is also occasionally termed the Bloodless Revolution, albeit inaccurately. The English Civil War (also known as the Great Rebellion) was still within living memory for most of the major English participants in the events of 1688, and for them, in comparison to that war (or even the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685) the deaths in the conflict of 1688 were mercifully few.[original research?]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glorious_Revolution	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/William_III_of_England.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/James_II_%26_VII.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Heraldic_Royal_Crown_%28Common%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Royal_Arms_of_England_%281198-1340%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Prince_of_Orange_engraving_by_William_Miller_after_Turner_R739.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Coat_of_Arms_of_England_%281558-1603%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Francisco_Lopes_Suasso.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Earl_of_Romney.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/be/Flag_of_England.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/William_III_Landing_at_Brixham%2C_Torbay%2C_5_November_1688.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/The_Seven_Bishops_committed_to_the_Tower_in_1688_from_NPG.jpg"]	f	cover
122	Opera	Opera (English plural: operas; Italian plural: opere) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (called a libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble.\nOpera is part of the Western classical music tradition. It started in Italy at the end of the 16th century (with Jacopo Peri's lost Dafne, produced in Florence in 1598) and soon spread through the rest of Europe: Schütz in Germany, Lully in France, and Purcell in England all helped to establish their national traditions in the 17th century. In the 18th century, Italian opera continued to dominate most of Europe, except France, attracting foreign composers such as Handel. Opera seria was the most prestigious form of Italian opera, until Gluck reacted against its artificiality with his "reform" operas in the 1760s. Today the most renowned figure of late 18th century opera is Mozart, who began with opera seria but is most famous for his Italian comic operas, especially The Marriage of Figaro (Le Nozze Di Figaro), Don Giovanni, and Così fan tutte, as well as The Magic Flute (Die Zauberflöte), a landmark in the German tradition.\nThe first third of the 19th century saw the high point of the bel canto style, with Rossini, Donizetti and Bellini all creating works that are still performed today. It also saw the advent of Grand Opera typified by the works of Auber and Meyerbeer. The mid-to-late 19th century was a "golden age" of opera, led and dominated by Wagner in Germany and Verdi in Italy. The popularity of opera continued through the verismo era in Italy and contemporary French opera through to Puccini and Strauss in the early 20th century. During the 19th century, parallel operatic traditions emerged in central and eastern Europe, particularly in Russia and Bohemia. The 20th century saw many experiments with modern styles, such as atonality and serialism (Schoenberg and Berg), Neoclassicism (Stravinsky), and Minimalism (Philip Glass and John Adams). With the rise of recording technology, singers such as Enrico Caruso became known to audiences beyond the circle of opera fans. Operas were also performed on (and written for) radio and television.\n\n	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Henry_Purcell.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart_-_Don_Giovanni_-_Overt%C3%BCre.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/The_Mikado_Three_Little_Maids.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Thomas_Augustine_Arne.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Verdi.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Pasquale_Amato%2C_Georges_Bizet%2C_Chanson_du_tor%C3%A9ador%2C_Carmen.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Operalogo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/No_Pagliaccio_non_son.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Paris_Opera_full_frontal_architecture%2C_May_2009.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Pannini%2C_Giovanni_Paolo_-_Musical_F%C3%AAte_-_1747.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/RichardWagner.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Rheingold_%28Ferdinand_Leeke%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Schiele_-_Bildnis_des_Komponisten_Arnold_Sch%C3%B6nberg_._1917.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Salzburger_Festspiele_2012_-_Carmen.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Stay%2C_Prince_and_hear.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Senesino_portrait_edited.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Gluck%27s_Orph%C3%A9e_-_title_page_illustration_%28lightened_and_cropped%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Feodor_Chaliapin_as_Ivan_Susanin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Haendel.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Gnome-mime-audio-openclipart.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Armide_Lully_by_Saint-Aubin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Claudio_Monteverdi.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Ceskystage.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/La_Donna_E_Mobile_Rigoletto.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Igor_Stravinsky_Essays.jpg"]	f	cover
90	Cardinal Mazarin	Jules Mazarin (French: [ʒyl mazaʁɛ̃]; July 14, 1602 – March 9, 1661), born Giulio Raimondo Mazzarino [ˈdʒuljo raiˈmondo maddzaˈrino] or Mazarini, was an Italian Catholic cardinal, diplomat, and politician, who served as the chief minister of France from 1642 until his death. Mazarin succeeded his mentor, Cardinal Richelieu. He was a noted collector of art and jewels, particularly diamonds, and he bequeathed the "Mazarin diamonds" to Louis XIV in 1661, some of which remain in the collection of the Louvre museum in Paris. His personal library was the origin of the Bibliothèque Mazarine in Paris.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_Mazarin	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Royal_Standard_of_the_Kingdom_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Cardinal_Jules_Mazarin_by_Robert_Nanteuil_1656.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Jules_Mazarin.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Coat_of_Arms_of_France.svg"]	f	cover
92	War of the Spanish Succession	The War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714) was fought between European powers, including a divided Spain, over who had the right to succeed Charles II as King of Spain.\nThe war was fought mostly in Europe but included Queen Anne's War in North America. It was marked by the leadership of notable generals including the Duc de Villars, the Jacobite Duke of Berwick, and especially the successful partnership of the Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene of Savoy. Several battles are considered classics in military history, notably the Grand Alliance victories at Blenheim (1704) and Ramillies (1706), which drove the French forces from Germany and the Netherlands, and the Franco-Bourbon Spanish victory at Almansa (1707), which in turn broke the Grand Alliance hold over Spain. The war concluded with the Peace of Utrecht (1713), in which the warring states recognised the French candidate as King Philip V of Spain in exchange for territorial and economic concessions.\nIn the years preceding the war, Spain's military was neglected during the long reign of its last Habsburg king, Charles II, so that by 1700 Spain had effectively slipped from the ranks of the great powers. However, Spain still possessed by far the largest empire in the world, with possessions in Europe and the Far East, vast territories in the Americas, and strongholds in North Africa and elsewhere. When Charles II designated Philip of Anjou, a grandson of Louis XIV, as his successor, the Grand Alliance intervened to prevent a dynastic unification of Spain with France, then the dominant military power on the continent, fearing that such a union would drastically alter the balance of power.\nBecause of this, France entered the war diplomatically isolated. Having the support only of its traditional ally, the Electorate of Bavaria (itself knocked out of the war in 1704), and those Spanish loyal to Philip, France faced a Grand Alliance composed of the Holy Roman Empire, Great Britain, the Dutch Republic, Portugal and the Duchy of Savoy, all determined to preserve the Spanish throne for their Habsburg candidate, Archduke Charles.\nSpain itself became divided over which pretender should ascend the Spanish throne and suffered a long series of sieges and skirmishes, until a Franco-Bourbon Spanish victory at Villaviciosa (1710) decisively ended Habsburg hopes. In Flanders, the war went badly for France. In a series of intricate manoeuvres and campaigns, French generals were repeatedly defeated by Marlborough and Eugene. Following a French defeat at Oudenarde (1708), Lille, the last of France's major northern fortifications, fell to a protracted siege, opening a corridor towards Paris. These dire reverses prompted Louis XIV to sue for peace, but the Grand Alliance imposed humiliating terms and he decided to press the war to its end.\nAt the same time, a series of events led to the Grand Alliance faltering. At the Battle of Malplaquet (1709) the Alliance invasion of France was blunted by French forces under the Duc de Villars. Following the pyrrhic victory, Marlborough was recalled to London, which, combined with a new parliament pressing for peace, dramatically reduced the effectiveness of the British forces. Negotiations between France and Britain started in secret. In 1711, Archduke Charles' elder brother Joseph died and the Archduke became Emperor Charles VI. Other members of the Alliance were thus presented with the dilemma of a possible Austro-Spanish power bloc in place of a Franco-Spanish one. Meanwhile, continued skirmishing, sieges, and battles allowed the French to re-capture much ground, especially after Villars' decisive victory at Denain (1712). Unable to resist French advances without British support, first the Dutch, then the Austrians, formally sued for peace.\nThe war was concluded by the treaties of Utrecht (1713) and Rastatt (1714). The negotiated settlements recognised the Bourbon pretender Philip V as King of Spain but required him to be removed from the French line of succession, averting a personal union of the two kingdoms. The Austrians gained most of the Spanish territories in Italy and the Netherlands and the British were granted the right to slave trading in Spain's American colonies for thirty years, as well as gaining Gibraltar and Minorca. France's hegemony over continental Europe was ended and the idea of a balance of power became a part of the European order. Philip revived Spanish territorial claims; taking advantage of the power vacuum caused by Louis XIV's death in 1715, Philip announced he would claim the French crown if the infant Louis XV died and attempted to reclaim Spanish territory in Italy, precipitating the War of the Quadruple Alliance in 1717.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Spanish_Succession	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Savoie_flag.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Vendome-and-PhilipV.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Royal_Standard_of_the_Kingdom_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/The_Battle_of_Hoechstaedt.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/The_Duke_of_Marlborough_at_the_Battle_of_Oudenaarde_%281708%29_by_John_Wootton.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Villars_a_Denain1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Jean_Baptiste_Martin_Schlacht_bei_Cassano_1705.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Joao_V_-Pierre_Antoine_Quillard.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Flag_of_Scotland.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Flag_of_the_Kingdom_of_Prussia_%281701-1750%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Flag_of_Austria.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Flag_of_Bavaria_%28lozengy%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Flag_of_Cross_of_Burgundy.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Flag_of_Hanover_%281692%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Schellenberg_1704.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Battle_of_Vigo_bay_october_23_1702.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Battle_of_Malplaquet%2C_1709.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Blenheim_1704.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/BattleofTurin.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Derrota-i-humillacion_borbonica-en-almenar-27-7-1710-catalu%C3%B1a.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Claude_Louis_Hector_duc_de_Villars.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Europe_c._1700.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Europe_1714.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Flag_Portugal_%281707%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Europe_green_light.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9a/Flag_of_Spain.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Ramillies1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Prinz-Eugen-von-Savoyen1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Prinsenvlag.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Portrait_of_Charles_III_of_Habsburg.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Philip-V-Making-1st-Duke-of-Berwick.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Marlborough-duke-first.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Louis_XIV_of_France.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Kupferstich%2C_Carpi_1701%2C_Detail_1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/King_Philip_V_of_Spain.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/King_Charles_II_of_Spain.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Banner_of_the_Holy_Roman_Emperor_%28after_1400%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Bandera_de_Espa%C3%B1a_1701-1760.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/BattleOfFriedlingen.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Batalladealmansa.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/1706-05-23-Slag_bij_Ramillies.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Bandera_de_Espa%C3%B1a_1701-1760.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Agust_Querfurt_H%C3%B6chst%C3%A4dt_Detail_Eugen_von_Savoyen.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/be/Flag_of_England.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Battle_of_Malaga%2C_1704.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Battle_of_Almansa.jpg"]	f	cover
94	Treaty of Utrecht	The Treaty of Utrecht, which established the Peace of Utrecht, is a series of individual peace treaties, rather than a single document, signed by the belligerents in the War of the Spanish Succession, in the Dutch city of Utrecht in March and April 1713. The treaties between several European states, including Spain, Great Britain, France, Portugal, Savoy and the Dutch Republic, helped end the war.\nThe treaties were concluded between the representatives of Louis XIV of France and of his grandson Philip V of Spain on one hand, and representatives of Anne, Queen of Great Britain, the Duke of Savoy, the King of Portugal and the United Provinces of the Netherlands on the other. They marked the end of French ambitions of hegemony in Europe expressed in the wars of Louis XIV and preserved the European system based on the balance of power.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Utrecht	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/The_Treaty_of_Utrecht_%28clean%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Flag_of_Gibraltar.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Flag_Portugal_%281707%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Prinsenvlag.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/People_icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Allegory_on_the_Peace_of_Utrecht.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Western_Europe_Utrecht_Treaty.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Coat_of_arms_of_Gibraltar1.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Bandera_de_Espa%C3%B1a_1701-1760.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Savoie_flag.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Royal_Standard_of_the_Kingdom_of_France.svg"]	f	cover
133	Concerto	A concerto (from the Italian: concerto, plural concerti or, often, the anglicised form concertos) is a musical composition usually composed in three parts or movements, in which (usually) one solo instrument (for instance, a piano, violin, cello or flute) is accompanied by an orchestra or concert band.\nThe etymology is uncertain, but the word seems to have originated from the conjunction of the two Latin words conserere (meaning to tie, to join, to weave) and certamen (competition, fight): the idea is that the two parts in a concerto, the soloist and the orchestra or concert band, alternate episodes of opposition, cooperation, and independence in the creation of the music flow.\nThe concerto, as understood in this modern way, arose in the Baroque period side by side with the concerto grosso, which contrasted a small group of instruments with the rest of the orchestra. The popularity of the concerto grosso form declined after the Baroque period, and the genre was not revived until the 20th century. The solo concerto, however, has remained a vital musical force from its inception to this day.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concerto	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Adolph_Menzel_-_Fl%C3%B6tenkonzert_Friedrichs_des_Gro%C3%9Fen_in_Sanssouci_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Classical_concerto_sonata_form.png"]	f	cover
143	George Frideric Handel	George Frideric Handel (/ˈhændəl/; German: Georg Friedrich Händel; German pronunciation: [ˈhɛndəl]; (1685-02-23)23 February 1685 – 14 April 1759(1759-04-14)) was a German-born Baroque composer famous for his operas, oratorios, anthems and organ concertos. Born in a family indifferent to music, Handel received critical training in Halle, Hamburg and Italy before settling in London (1712), and became a naturalized British subject in 1727. By then he was strongly influenced by the great composers of the Italian Baroque and the middle-German polyphonic choral tradition.\nWithin fifteen years, Handel had started three commercial opera companies to supply the English nobility with Italian opera. In 1737 he had a physical breakdown, changed direction creatively and addressed the middle class. As Alexander's Feast (1736) was well received, Handel made a transition to English choral works. After his success with Messiah (1742) he never performed an Italian opera again. Handel was only partly successful with his performances of English oratorio on mythical and biblical themes, but when he arranged a performance of Messiah to benefit London's Foundling Hospital (1750) the criticism ended. It has been said that the passion of Handel's oratorios is an ethical one, and that they are hallowed not by liturgical dignity but by moral ideals of humanity. Almost blind, and having lived in England for almost fifty years, he died in 1759, a respected and rich man. His funeral was given full state honours, and he was buried in Westminster Abbey.\nHandel is regarded as one of the greatest composers of the Baroque era, with works such as Water Music, Music for the Royal Fireworks and Messiah remaining popular. One of his four Coronation Anthems, Zadok the Priest (1727), composed for the coronation of George II of Great Britain, has been performed at every subsequent British coronation, traditionally during the sovereign's anointing. Handel composed more than forty operas in over thirty years, and since the late 1960s, with the revival of baroque music and original instrumentation, interest in Handel's operas has grown.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Frideric_Handel	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/HandelVA.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Hamburgs_Oper.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/London_Handel_House.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Joseph_Goupy%2C_1754_-_GFHandel.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Masquerade_at_the_King%27s_Theatre_Haymarket_c1724.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/London_Kings_Theatre_Haymarket.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Senesino.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Office-book.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Teatro_niccolini_11.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Retrato_de_Handel.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/George_Frideric_Handel_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Georg_Friedrich_H%C3%A4ndel_3.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/George_Frideric_Handel_by_Balthasar_Denner.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/George_Frideric_Handel_baptismal_register.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Commemoration_of_Handel_1784.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/GeorgIvonGro%C3%9FbritannienGeorgFriedrichHaendelHamman.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Frederick%2C_Prince_of_Wales%2C_and_his_sisters_by_Philip_Mercier.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Halle_an_der_Saale_Haendelhaus.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Haendel.jpg"]	f	cover
97	Stadtholder	A stadtholder (Dutch: stadhouder, Dutch pronunciation: [ˈstɑtˌɦʌudər]), literally place holder (holding someone's place, possibly a calque of German Statthalter, French lieutenant, or Medieval Latin locum tenens), was a term for a "steward" or "lieutenant". In the Low Countries, the stadtholder was a medieval function, which during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries developed into a rare type of de facto hereditary head of state of the thus crowned republic of the Netherlands. It is comparable with the French title Lieutenant and England's 16th century Lord Lieutenant. Additionally, this position was tasked with maintaining peace and provincial order in the early Dutch Republic. The Dutch Monarchy is a cognatic descendant of the first Stadtholder of the young Republic, William of Orange. He was the leader of the successful Dutch Revolt against the Spanish Empire.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadtholder	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Antonio_Moro_-_Willem_I_van_Nassau.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg"]	f	cover
99	Long Parliament	The Long Parliament of England, after the fiasco of the Short Parliament followed its 12 year abeyance, was established on 3 November 1640 to pass financial bills, following the Bishops' Wars. It received its name from the fact that through an Act of Parliament, it could be dissolved only with the agreement of the members, and those members did not agree to its dissolution until after the English Civil War and close to the end of Interregnum on 16 March 1660. It sat from 1640 until 1648, when it was purged by the New Model Army. In the chaos following the death of Oliver Cromwell in 1658, General George Monck allowed the members barred in 1648 to retake their seats, so that they could pass the necessary legislation to allow the Restoration and dissolve the Long Parliament. This cleared the way for a new Parliament to be elected, which was known as the Convention Parliament. But, many of these original members of Long Parliament, such as were barred from the final acts of the Long Parliament, claimed that the Long Parliament was never legally dissolved.\nThe Long Parliament comprised "a set of the greatest geniuses for government, that the world ever saw embarked together in one common cause" and whose actions produced an effect, which, at the time, made their country the wonder and admiration of the world, and is still felt and exhibited far beyond the borders of that country, in the progress of reform, and the advancement of popular liberty. The Long Parliament and the republican views of many of the members of the Long Parliament are believed by some historians, such as Charles Upham, as a precursor to the American Revolutionary War, based on the same republican principles.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Parliament	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/LongParliament.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Attempted_Arrest_of_the_Five_members_by_Charles_West_Cope.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/CromwellDissolvingLongParliament.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Coat_of_Arms_of_England_%281603-1649%29.svg"]	f	cover
100	English Civil War	The English Civil War (1642–1651) was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians ("Roundheads") and Royalists ("Cavaliers") in the Kingdom of England over, principally, the manner of its government. The first (1642–46) and second (1648–49) wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third (1649–51) saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The war ended with the Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651.\nThe overall outcome of the war was threefold: the trial and execution of Charles I; the exile of his son, Charles II; and the replacement of English monarchy with, at first, the Commonwealth of England (1649–53) and then the Protectorate (1653–59) under Oliver Cromwell's personal rule. The monopoly of the Church of England on Christian worship in England ended with the victors consolidating the established Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland. Constitutionally, the wars established the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without Parliament's consent, although this concept was legally established only as part of the Glorious Revolution in 1688.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Civil_War	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b8/Massacre_at_Drogheda.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/William_Laud.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Oliver_Cromwell_by_Samuel_Cooper.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Musket_volley_by_Sealed_Knot.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Rupert_of_the_Rhine.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Royal_Arms_of_England_%281198-1340%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Skull_and_crossbones.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Sir_Peter_Lely_001.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Cromwell_at_Dunbar_Andrew_Carrick_Gow.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Coat_of_Arms_of_England_%281558-1603%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/King_Charles_I_after_original_by_van_Dyck.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/English_civil_war_map_1642_to_1645.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Battle_of_Marston_Moor%2C_1644.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Civil_war_reeanactment.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Battle_of_Naseby.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/be/Flag_of_England.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/LongParliament.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Lastseefather.jpg"]	f	cover
168	Reductionism	Reductionism is a philosophical position which holds that a complex system is nothing but the sum of its parts, and that an account of it can be reduced to accounts of individual constituents. This can be said of objects, phenomena, explanation, theories, and meanings.\nReductionism strongly reflects a certain perspective on causality. In a reductionist framework, the phenomena that can be explained completely in terms of relations between other more fundamental phenomena, are called epiphenomena. Often there is an implication that the epiphenomenon exerts no causal agency on the fundamental phenomena that explain it.\nReductionism does not preclude the existence of what might be called emergent phenomena, but it does imply the ability to understand those phenomena completely in terms of the processes from which they are composed. This reductionist understanding is very different from that usually implied by the term 'emergence', which typically intends that what emerges is more than the sum of the processes from which it emerges.\nReligious reductionism generally attempts to explain religion by boiling it down to certain nonreligious causes. A few examples of reductionistic explanations for the presence of religion are: that religion can be reduced to humanity's conceptions of right and wrong, that religion is fundamentally a primitive attempt at controlling our environments, that religion is a way to explain the existence of a physical world, and that religion confers an enhanced survivability for members of a group and so is reinforced by natural selection. Anthropologists Edward Burnett Tylor and James George Frazer employed some religious reductionist arguments. Sigmund Freud held that religion is nothing more than an illusion, or even a mental illness, and Marx claimed that religion is "the sigh of the oppressed," and the opium of the people providing only "the illusory happiness of the people," thus providing two influential examples of reductionistic views against the idea of religion.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Nicolas_P._Rougier%27s_rendering_of_the_human_brain.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Nicolas_P._Rougier%27s_rendering_of_the_human_brain.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Duck_of_Vaucanson.jpg"]	f	cover
101	Oliver Cromwell	Oliver Cromwell (25 April 1599 – 3 September 1658) was an English military and political leader and later Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland.\nBorn into the middle gentry, Cromwell was relatively obscure for the first 40 years of his life. After undergoing a religious conversion in the 1630s, he became an independent puritan, taking a generally (but not completely) tolerant view towards the many Protestant sects of his period. An intensely religious man—a self-styled Puritan Moses—he fervently believed that God was guiding his victories. He was elected Member of Parliament for Huntingdon in 1628 and for Cambridge in the Short (1640) and Long (1640–49) Parliaments. He entered the English Civil War on the side of the "Roundheads" or Parliamentarians. Nicknamed "Old Ironsides", he was quickly promoted from leading a single cavalry troop to become one of the principal commanders of the New Model Army, playing an important role in the defeat of the royalist forces.\nCromwell was one of the signatories of King Charles I's death warrant in 1649, and, as a member of the Rump Parliament (1649–53), he dominated the short-lived Commonwealth of England. He was selected to take command of the English campaign in Ireland in 1649–50. Cromwell's forces defeated the Confederate and Royalist coalition in Ireland and occupied the country – bringing to an end the Irish Confederate Wars. During this period a series of Penal Laws were passed against Roman Catholics (a significant minority in England and Scotland but the vast majority in Ireland), and a substantial amount of their land was confiscated. Cromwell also led a campaign against the Scottish army between 1650 and 1651.\nOn 20 April 1653 he dismissed the Rump Parliament by force, setting up a short-lived nominated assembly known as the Barebones Parliament, before being invited by his fellow leaders to rule as Lord Protector of England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland from 16 December 1653. As a ruler he executed an aggressive and effective foreign policy. After his death from natural causes in 1658 he was buried in Westminster Abbey, but after the Royalists returned to power in 1660 they had his corpse dug up, hung in chains, and beheaded.\nCromwell is one of the most controversial figures in the history of the British Isles, considered a regicidal dictator by historians such as David Hume, a military dictator by Winston Churchill, but a hero of liberty by Thomas Carlyle and Samuel Rawson Gardiner. In a 2002 BBC poll in Britain, Cromwell was selected as one of the ten greatest Britons of all time. However, his measures against Catholics in Scotland and Ireland have been characterised as genocidal or near-genocidal, and in Ireland his record is harshly criticised.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Cromwell	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Oliver_Cromwell_House_Ely.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Moray_House_in_the_Canongate.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Oliver_Cromwell_by_Samuel_Cooper.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Oliver_Cromwell_by_Robert_Walker.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Oliver_Cromwell_statue%2C_Westminster.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/Signature_of_Oliver_Cromwell_%281651%29.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/WarwickCastle_CromwellDeathmaskcrop.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Standard_of_Oliver_Cromwell_%281653%E2%80%931659%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Cromwell_as_a_usurper.tiff", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Court-charles-I-sm.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Cromwellcoin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Cromwell_signature.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Arms_of_the_Protectorate_%281653%E2%80%931659%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Coat_of_Arms_of_the_Protectorate_%281653%E2%80%931659%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Coat_of_Arms_of_the_Commonwealth_of_England.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Execution_of_Cromwell%2C_Bradshaw_and_Ireton%2C_1661.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Elizabeth_Cromwell.jpg"]	f	cover
320	Antonio López de Santa Anna	Antonio de Padua María Severino López de Santa Anna y Pérez de Lebrón (21 February 1794 – 21 June 1876), often known as Santa Anna or López de Santa Anna and sometimes called "the Napoleon of the West", was a Mexican politician and general who greatly influenced early Mexican politics and government. Santa Anna fought first against Mexican independence from Spain, then in support of it. Though not the first caudillo (military leader) of Mexico, he was among the earliest.\nHe was general and president multiple times over a turbulent 40-year career; he was president on eleven non-consecutive occasions over a period of 22 years. A wealthy landowner, he built a firm political base in the major port city of Veracruz. He was the hero of the Army; he sought glory for himself and his army, and repeatedly rebuilt it after major losses. A brave soldier and a cunning politician, he so dominated his era that historians often call it the "Age of Santa Anna."\nHowever, historians also report that he is "perhaps the principal inhabitant even today of Mexico's pantheon of 'those who failed the nation.'" His centralist rhetoric and military failures resulted in Mexico losing just over half its territory, beginning with the Texas Revolution and culminating with the Mexican Cession of 1848.	\N	\N	\N	http://texashistoricalfoundation.org/thf/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Santa-Anna.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_L%C3%B3pez_de_Santa_Anna	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Seal_of_the_Government_of_Mexico.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Antonio_L%C3%B3pez_de_Santa_Anna_signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Antonio_Lopez_de_Santa_Anna_c1870.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Juan_Cordero_-_Portrait_of_Do%C3%B1a_Dolores_Tosta_de_Santa_Anna_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Combat_de_Vera_Cruz_1838_Prince_de_Joinville_attaque_la_maison_du_general_Arista.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Antonio_Lopez_de_Santa_Anna.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Antonio_Lopez_de_Santa_Anna_c1853.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Antonio_Lopez_de_Santa_Anna_1852.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Santaanna1.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Oleo_Antonio_Lopez_de_Santa_Anna.PNG"]	f	50%
197	Frederick the Great	Frederick II (German: Friedrich II.; 24 January 1712 – 17 August 1786) was King in Prussia (1740–1786) of the Hohenzollern dynasty. He is best known for his military victories, his reorganization of Prussian armies, his innovative drills and tactics, and his final success against great odds in the Seven Years' War. He became known as Frederick the Great (Friedrich der Große) and was nicknamed Der Alte Fritz ("Old Fritz").\nIn his youth, Frederick was more interested in music and philosophy than the art of war. He defied his authoritarian father, Frederick William I, and sought to run away with his close friend Hans Hermann von Katte. They were caught and the king nearly executed his son for "desertion"; he did force Frederick to watch the execution of Hans. Upon ascending to the Prussian throne, he attacked Austria and claimed Silesia during the Silesian Wars, winning military acclaim for himself and Prussia. Near the end of his life, Frederick physically connected most of his realm by conquering Polish territories in the First Partition of Poland. He was an influential military theorist whose analysis emerged from his extensive personal battlefield experience and covered issues of strategy, tactics, mobility and logistics.\nFrederick was a proponent of enlightened absolutism. He modernized the Prussian bureaucracy and civil service and pursued religious policies throughout his realm that ranged from tolerance to oppression. He reformed the judicial system and made it possible for men not of noble stock to become judges and senior bureaucrats. Some critics however point out his oppressive measures against conquered Polish subjects. He limited freedom of citizens of his country[further explanation needed] and introduced harsh compulsory military service.\nFrederick supported arts and philosophers he favored, but at the same enacted several laws censoring the press. Frederick is buried at his favorite residence, Sanssouci in Potsdam. Because he died childless, Frederick was succeeded by his nephew, Frederick William II of Prussia, son of his brother, Prince Augustus William of Prussia.\nNearly all 19th century German historians made Frederick into a romantic model of a glorified warrior, praising his leadership, administrative efficiency, devotion to duty and success in building up Prussia to a leading role in Europe. Historian Leopold von Ranke was unstinting in his praise of Frederick's "Heroic life, inspired by great ideas, filled with feats of arms...immortalized by the raising of the Prussian state to the rank of a power." Johann Gustav Droysen was even more extolling. He remained an admired historical figure through the German Empire's crushing defeat in First World War, and the Nazis glorified him as great German leader pre-figuring Hitler, but his reputation became far less favorable after the fall of the Nazi regime in 1945 in both East and West Germany.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_the_Great	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3a/Portraitoffrederickthegreat.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/45/FrederickderGro%C3%9FeKn%C3%B6tel.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Friedrich_der_Grosse_vor_der_Schlacht_bei_Torgau.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Friedrich_der_Grosse_VS.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Hohenfriedeberg_-_Attack_of_Prussian_Infantry_-_1745.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Friedrich_der_grosse_grab_hg.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Potsdam_-_Schloss_Sanssouci.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Naoleon_in_Potsdam_am_Grab_Friedrichs_II_1806.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Wappen_Deutsches_Reich_-_K%C3%B6nigreich_Preussen_%28Grosses%29.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Rzeczpospolita_Rozbiory_1.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Friedrich_Zweite_Alt.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Batalla-kunersforf.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Baptism_of_Frederick.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Der_K%C3%B6nig_%C3%BCberall2.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Battle_rossbach_trap.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Acprussiamap2.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Antoine_Pesne_-_Frederick_the_Great_as_Crown_Prince_-_WGA17377.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Adolph_Menzel_-_Fl%C3%B6tenkonzert_Friedrichs_des_Gro%C3%9Fen_in_Sanssouci_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Frederick%27s_first_interview_with_Voltaire.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Flag_of_Prussia_1892-1918.svg"]	f	cover
265	Johann Wolfgang von Goethe	Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (German: [ˈjoːhan ˈvɔlfɡaŋ fɔn ˈɡøːtə] ( ), 28 August 1749 – 22 March 1832) was a German writer and politician. His body of work includes epic and lyric poetry written in a variety of metres and styles; prose and verse dramas; memoirs; an autobiography; literary and aesthetic criticism; treatises on botany, anatomy, and colour; and four novels. In addition, numerous literary and scientific fragments, more than 10,000 letters, and nearly 3,000 drawings by him are extant.\nA literary celebrity by the age of 25, Goethe was ennobled by the Duke of Saxe-Weimar, Carl August in 1782 after first taking up residence there in November of 1775 following the success of his first novel, The Sorrows of Young Werther. He was an early participant in the Sturm und Drang literary movement. During his first ten years in Weimar, Goethe served as a member of the Duke's privy council, sat on the war and highway commissions, oversaw the reopening of silver mines in nearby Ilmenau, and implemented a series of administrative reforms at the University of Jena. He also contributed to the planning of Weimar's botanical park and the rebuilding of its Ducal Palace, which in 1998 were together designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nAfter returning from a tour of Italy in 1788, his first major scientific work, the Metamorphosis of Plants, was published. In 1791 he was made managing director of the theatre at Weimar, and in 1794 he began a friendship with the dramatist, historian, and philosopher Friedrich Schiller, whose plays he premiered until Schiller's death in 1805. During this period Goethe published his second novel, Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship, the verse epic Hermann and Dorothea, and, in 1808, the first part of his most celebrated drama, Faust. His conversations and various common undertakings throughout the 1790s with Schiller, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Johann Gottfried Herder, Alexander von Humboldt, Wilhelm von Humboldt, and August and Friedrich Schlegel have, in later years, been collectively termed Weimar Classicism.\nArthur Schopenhauer cited Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship as one of the four greatest novels ever written[citation needed] and Ralph Waldo Emerson selected Goethe, along with Plato, Napoleon, and William Shakespeare, as one of six "representative men" in his work of the same name. Goethe's comments and observations form the basis of several biographical works, most notably Johann Peter Eckermann's Conversations with Goethe. There are frequent references to Goethe's various sayings and maxims throughout the course of Friedrich Nietzsche's work and there are numerous allusions to Goethe in the novels of Hermann Hesse and Thomas Mann as well as in the psychological writings of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. Goethe's poems were set to music throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries by a number of composers, including Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Schubert, Robert Schumann, Johannes Brahms, Charles Gounod, Richard Wagner, Hugo Wolf, and Gustav Mahler.	\N	\N	\N	http://www.nndb.com/people/962/000024890/goethe-sm.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Ulrike_von_Levetzow.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Weimarer_Klassik.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Goethe_%28Stieler_1828%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/GoetheAndSchillerMonumentAtWeimar.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Goethe_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Goethe_Monument_Chicago%2C_by_Hermann_Hahn.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Goethehaus-ffm011.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Goetheanum_Dornach.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Johann_Wolfgang_Goethe_1811.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Johann_Heinrich_Wilhelm_Tischbein_007.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Socrates.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Quill_and_ink.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Freiheitsbaum.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Der_junge_Goethe%2C_gemalt_von_Angelica_Kauffmann_1787.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Goethe-LightSpectrum.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Goeothe_Denkmal_Leipzig.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/-1-_Die_Leiden_des_jungen_Werthers._Erstdruck_.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/De-Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Annakatharinaschoenkopf.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Goethe.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Goethe.GIF"]	f	cover
104	Levellers	The Levellers were a political movement during the English Civil War which emphasised popular sovereignty, extended suffrage, equality before the law, and religious tolerance, all of which were expressed in the manifesto "Agreement of the People". They came to prominence at the end of the First English Civil War and were most influential before the start of the Second Civil War. Leveller views and support were found in the populace of the City of London and in some regiments in the New Model Army.\nThe levellers were not a political party in the modern sense of the word, and did not all conform to a specific manifesto. They were organised at the national level, with offices in a number of London inns and taverns such as The Rosemary Branch in Islington which got its name from the sprigs of rosemary that Levellers would wear in their hats as a sign of identification. From July 1648 to September 1649 they published a newspaper The Moderate, and were pioneers in the use of petitions and pamphleteering to political ends. They identified themselves by sea-green ribbons worn on their clothing. After Pride's Purge and the execution of Charles I, power lay in the hands of the Grandees in the Army (and to a lesser extent with the Rump Parliament). The Levellers, along with all other opposition groups, were marginalised by those in power and their influence waned. By 1650, they were no longer a serious threat to the established order.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levellers	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/LevellersBiggsPiggenOxford.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Levellers_plaque_Burford.jpg"]	f	cover
36	Indulgence	In Catholic theology, an indulgence technically is a remission of the temporal punishment inflicted by the Church for a previously forgiven sin. An indulgence thus does not forgive the guilt of sin nor releases from the eternal punishment which Church doctrine associates to unforgiven mortal sins. It is not a permit to commit sin, a pardon of future sin, nor a guarantee of salvation for oneself or for another. Ordinarily, forgiveness of mortal sins is obtained through Confession (i.e., penance or reconciliation).\nIndulgences have replaced the remission of the severe penances of the early Church which was granted at the intercession of Christians awaiting martyrdom or at least imprisoned for the faith. They draw on the Treasury of Merit accumulated by Christ's superabundantly meritorious sacrifice on the cross and the virtues and penances of the saints. They are granted for specific good works and prayers in proportion to the devotion with which those good works are performed or prayers recited.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indulgence	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/62/PD-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/Israhel_van_Meckenem_The_Mass_of_Saint_Gregory.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Indulgence_San_Giovanni_in_Laterano_2006-09-07.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/Orthodox_Indulgence.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Jeorg_Breu_Elder_A_Question_to_a_Mintmaker_c1500.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/046CupolaSPietro.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Indulgence2.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Antichrist1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/StPetersBasilicaEarlyMorning.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Socvillegas4jf.JPG"]	f	cover
279	Frédéric Chopin	Frédéric François Chopin (/ˈʃoʊpæn/; French pronunciation: ​[fʁe.de.ʁik ʃɔ.pɛ̃]; 22 February or 1 March 1810 – 17 October 1849), born Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin, was a Romantic-era Polish composer. A child prodigy, Chopin was born in what was then the Duchy of Warsaw. He grew up in Warsaw, which after 1815 became part of Congress Poland, and there completed his musical education and composed many of his works before leaving Poland, aged 20, less than a month before the outbreak of the November 1830 Uprising.\nAt the age of 21 he settled in Paris (obtaining French citizenship in 1835). During the remaining 18 years of his life, he gave only some 30 public performances, preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the salon; he supported himself by selling his compositions and as a sought-after piano teacher, and gained renown as a leading virtuoso of his generation. He formed a friendship with Franz Liszt and was admired by many of his musical contemporaries, including Robert Schumann. After a failed engagement with a Polish girl, from 1837 to 1847 he maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer George Sand. A brief and unhappy visit with Sand to Majorca in 1838–39 was one of his most productive periods of composition. In his last years, he was financially supported by his admirer Jane Stirling, who also arranged for him to visit Scotland in 1848. Through most of his life, Chopin suffered from poor health; he died in Paris in 1849, probably of tuberculosis.\nAll of Chopin's compositions include the piano; most are for solo piano, although he also wrote two piano concertos, a few chamber pieces, and some songs to Polish lyrics. His keyboard style, which is highly individual, is often technically demanding; his own performances were noted for their nuance and sensitivity. Chopin invented the concept of instrumental ballade; his major piano works also include sonatas, mazurkas, waltzes, nocturnes, polonaises, études, impromptus, scherzos, and preludes, some published only after his death. Many contain elements of both Polish folk music and of the classical tradition of J.S. Bach, Mozart and Schubert, whom he particularly admired. His innovations in style, musical form, and harmony, and his association of music with nationalism, were influential throughout and after the late Romantic period.\nBoth in his native Poland and beyond, Chopin's music, his status as one of music's earliest 'superstars', his association (if only indirect) with political insurrection, his amours and his early death have made him, in the public consciousness, a leading symbol of the Romantic era. His works remain popular, and he has been the subject of numerous films and biographies of varying degrees of historical accuracy.	\N	\N	\N	http://www.8notes.com/wiki/images/250px-ChopinDelacroix.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Chopin	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Jane_stirling_par_deveria.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Poland_Zelazowa_Wola.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Pomnik_Fryderyka_Chopina_w_%C5%81azienkach_%281_of_1%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Miko%C5%82aj_Chopin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Op_62-1ms.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Ostatnie_chwile_Fryderyka_Chopina.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Pere-Lachaise_Chopin_grave.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Giorgi_Latsabidze_Plays_Mazurka.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Gnome-mime-audio-openclipart.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/J%C3%B3zef_Elsner.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Maria_Wodzi%C5%84ska.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Frederic_Chopin_photo.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Chopin_signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Chopin_op_62-1_pr.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Epitaph_for_heart_of_Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Chopin_in_Holy_Cross_Church_in_Warsaw.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Chopinamqsop53.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Eug%C3%A8ne_Ferdinand_Victor_Delacroix_043.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Eug%C3%A8ne_Ferdinand_Victor_Delacroix_041.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Frederic_Chopin_-_Opus_10_-_Twelve_Grand_Etudes_-_c_minor.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Frederic_Chopin-Trois_Valses_Op._64_No._1_Des-Dur_Piano_Peter_Gerwinski.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Frederick_Chopin_-_Concerto_2_in_F_minor%2C_1st_movement.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Frederic_Chopin_-_Opus_25_-_Twelve_Grand_Etudes_-_f_minor.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Chopin_polonaise_Op._53.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Chopin_Prelude_Op_28_N_15_Giorgi_Latsabidze_performs.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Chopin_Parlour_in_Warsaw.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Chopin_death_mask%2C_side_view_%28collection_of_Jack_Gibbons%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Chopin_concert.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/CHopin_SIgnature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Chopin_Museum_in_Warsaw_03.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Chopin%2C_by_Wodzinska.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Chopin_home%2C_1817-27.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Chopin_death_mask_%28collection_of_Jack_Gibbons%29.jpg"]	f	cover
272	Lord Byron	George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron, later George Gordon Noel, 6th Baron Byron, FRS (22 January 1788 – 19 April 1824), commonly known simply as Lord Byron, was an English poet and a leading figure in the Romantic movement. Among Byron's best-known works are the lengthy narrative poems Don Juan and Childe Harold's Pilgrimage and the short lyric She Walks in Beauty. He is regarded as one of the greatest British poets and remains widely read and influential.\nHe travelled all over Europe especially in Italy where he lived for seven years and then joined the Greek War of Independence fighting the Ottoman Empire, for which Greeks revere him as a national hero. He died one year later at age 36 from a fever contracted while in Missolonghi in Greece.\nOften described as the most flamboyant and notorious of the major Romantics, Byron was celebrated in life for aristocratic excesses, including huge debts, numerous love affairs with both sexes, rumours of a scandalous incestuous liaison with his half-sister, and self-imposed exile.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Byron	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Lord_Byron_-_Childe_Harold%27s_Pilgimage_-_Dugdale_edition.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Allegra_Byron.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c8/Bride_of_abydos_1857_950px.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Teresa_Makri_1870.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Ottawa_Public_Library_.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Portrait_of_Percy_Bysshe_Shelley_by_Curran%2C_1819.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Quill_and_ink.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/RothwellMaryShelley.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d3/Byron%27s_Stone_near_Tepelene.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Claire_Clairmont%2C_by_Amelia_Curran.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Hon._Augusta_Leigh.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/George_Gordon_Byron%2C_6th_Baron_Byron_by_Richard_Westall_%282%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/John_Fitzgibbon_2nd_Earl_of_Clare-cropped.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Jane_elizabeth_countess-of-oxford1797_john_hoppner.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Lord_Byron1.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/La_Grotta_di_Byron.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/Lord_Byron_on_his_Death-bed_c._1826.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Lord_Byron_in_Albanian_dress.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Nuvola_apps_package_graphics.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Nuvola_LGBT_flag_borderless.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d6/CaptainByron.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Byron_1824.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Bayron%27s_visit_to_San_Lazzaro_by_Aivazovsky_%281899%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Byronshouse266.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/Byronmother.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Ada_Lovelace_1838.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Autograph-LordByron.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Annabella_Byron_%281792-1860%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/01/A_coloured_voting_box.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/ElizabethMedoraLeigh.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Carolinelamb.jpg"]	f	cover
321	Leopold II of Belgium	Leopold II (French: Léopold Louis Philippe Marie Victor, Dutch: Leopold Lodewijk Filips Maria Victor; 9 April 1835 – 17 December 1909) was the second King of the Belgians, and is chiefly remembered for the founding and exploitation of the Congo Free State. Born in Brussels the second (but eldest surviving) son of Leopold I and Louise of Orléans, he succeeded his father to the throne on 17 December 1865, reigning for 44 years until his death, the longest of any Belgian monarch.\nLeopold was the founder and sole owner of the Congo Free State, a private project undertaken on his own behalf. He used Henry Morton Stanley to help him lay claim to the Congo, an area now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. At the Berlin Conference of 1884–1885, the colonial nations of Europe committed the Congo Free State to improving the lives of the native inhabitants. From the beginning, however, Leopold essentially ignored these conditions and ran the Congo using a mercenary force for his personal gain. Some of the money from this exploitation was used for public and private construction projects in Belgium during this period.\nLeopold extracted a fortune from the Congo, initially by the collection of ivory, and after a rise in the price of rubber in the 1890s, by forcing the population to collect sap from rubber plants. Villages were required to meet quotas on rubber collections, and individuals' hands were cut off if they did not meet the requirements. His regime was responsible for the death of an estimated 2 to 15 million Congolese. This became one of the most infamous international scandals of the early 20th century, and Leopold was ultimately forced to relinquish control of it to the Belgian government.	\N	\N	\N	http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tLTiaIwWQyI/T2U-wAv6B4I/AAAAAAAAIMc/fln-srzsh7E/s1600/mon_his_leopold_II_high.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_II_of_Belgium	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Your_Majesty%21_at_your_age....jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Leopold_of_Belgium%2C_Duke_of_Brabant%3B_Nicaise_de_Keyser.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Leopold_ii_garter_knight.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/L%C3%A9opold_II_Bruxelles.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/L%C3%A9opold_II-Mus%C3%A9e_royal_de_l%27Afrique_centrale_%283%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Monument_%C3%A0_L%C3%A9opold_II_.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Maria_Hendrika_of_Austria_and_Leopod_of_Belgium.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Punch_congo_rubber_cartoon.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/MutilatedChildrenFromCongo.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Solemn_Funeral_of_the_King.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Royal_Monogram_of_King_Leopold_II%2C_King_of_the_Belgians.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2d/Leopold_II_gent.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Coat_of_arms_of_the_Congo_Free_State.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Coat_of_Arms_of_the_King_of_the_Belgians_%281837-1921%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Leopold_Duke_of_Brabant.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Leopold2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/1884_Map_of_the_Belgium_Congo.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Brussels_Cinquantenaire_R02.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Blason_L%C3%A9opold_II_de_Belgique_%281835-1909%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Leopold_ii_belgien.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Leopold_II%2C_Vanity_Fair%2C_1869-10-09.jpg"]	f	50%
306	Thomas Carlyle	Thomas Carlyle (4 December 1795 – 5 February 1881) was a Scottish philosopher, satirical writer, essayist, historian and teacher during the Victorian era. He called economics "the dismal science", wrote articles for the Edinburgh Encyclopedia, and became a controversial social commentator.\nCarlyle's strict Calvinist parents expected him to become a preacher, but he lost his Christian faith while attending the University of Edinburgh. He continued to believe in God, and Calvinist assumptions remained with him throughout his life. His combination of religious temperament with loss of faith in traditional Christianity made Carlyle's work appealing to many Victorians who grappled with scientific and political changes that threatened the traditional social order. He brought a trenchant style to his social and political criticism, and a complex literary style to works such as The French Revolution: A History (1837). Dickens used Carlyle's work as a primary source for events of the French Revolution in his novel A Tale of Two Cities.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Carlyle	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Whistler_James_Arrangement_in_Gray_and_Black_No2_1873.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f0/Craigenputtock_george_moir.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Thomas_Carlyle_lm.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Century_Mag_Ecclefechan.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Carlyle_grave.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Maurice.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Cameron_Carlyle_1867.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Carlyle_by_Elliott_%26_Fry_c1860s.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Carlyle%27s_House_Ampton_Street.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Thomas_Carlyle_daguerreotype%2C_1848.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Thomas_Carlyle_by_Sir_John_Everett_Millais%2C_1st_Bt.jpg"]	f	cover
285	Eugène Delacroix	Ferdinand Victor Eugène Delacroix (French: [ø.ʒɛn də.la.kʁwa]; 26 April 1798 – 13 August 1863) was a French Romantic artist regarded from the outset of his career as the leader of the French Romantic school. Delacroix's use of expressive brushstrokes and his study of the optical effects of colour profoundly shaped the work of the Impressionists, while his passion for the exotic inspired the artists of the Symbolist movement. A fine lithographer, Delacroix illustrated various works of William Shakespeare, the Scottish writer Walter Scott and the German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.\nIn contrast to the Neoclassical perfectionism of his chief rival Ingres, Delacroix took for his inspiration the art of Rubens and painters of the Venetian Renaissance, with an attendant emphasis on colour and movement rather than clarity of outline and carefully modelled form. Dramatic and romantic content characterized the central themes of his maturity, and led him not to the classical models of Greek and Roman art, but to travel in North Africa, in search of the exotic. Friend and spiritual heir to Théodore Géricault, Delacroix was also inspired by Lord Byron, with whom he shared a strong identification with the "forces of the sublime", of nature in often violent action.\nHowever, Delacroix was given to neither sentimentality nor bombast, and his Romanticism was that of an individualist. In the words of Baudelaire, "Delacroix was passionately in love with passion, but coldly determined to express passion as clearly as possible."	\N	\N	\N	http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_D2gjrcj_F28/TRpAj_UirKI/AAAAAAAAB38/RseVgKMswrw/s1600/liberty.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Delacroix	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/34/Arab_horses_fighting_in_a_stable_950px.jpg",

415	Louis Armstrong	Louis Armstrong (August 4, 1901 – July 6, 1971), nicknamed Satchmo or Pops, was an American jazz trumpeter and singer from New Orleans, Louisiana.\nComing to prominence in the 1920s as an "inventive" trumpet and cornet player, Armstrong was a foundational influence in jazz, shifting the focus of the music from collective improvisation to solo performance. With his instantly recognizable gravelly voice, Armstrong was also an influential singer, demonstrating great dexterity as an improviser, bending the lyrics and melody of a song for expressive purposes. He was also skilled at scat singing (vocalizing using sounds and syllables instead of actual lyrics).\nRenowned for his charismatic stage presence and voice almost as much as for his trumpet-playing, Armstrong's influence extends well beyond jazz music, and by the end of his career in the 1960s, he was widely regarded as a profound influence on popular music in general. Armstrong was one of the first truly popular African-American entertainers to "cross over", whose skin color was secondary to his music in an America that was severely racially divided. He rarely publicly politicized his race, often to the dismay of fellow African-Americans, but took a well-publicized stand for desegregation during the Little Rock Crisis. His artistry and personality allowed him socially acceptable access to the upper echelons of American society that were highly restricted for a black man.	\N	\N	\N	http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5gQu99enD_I/TUx0v2Qy7_I/AAAAAAAAAFc/kbzp-E5mKW0/s1600/Louis_Armstrong_restored.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Armstrong	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f7/Mack_The_Knife_Coronet.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/09/Louis_Armstrong_Skokiaan.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Louis_Armstrong_restored.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Louis_Armstrong2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d0/LouisArmstrong_PeterDavis1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Office-book.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Selmer_Trumpet_given_by_King_George_V_to_Louis_Armstrong.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Satchmo_Messuhallissa.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/VocalionMuggles.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/da/Heebie_Jeebies.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9f/Louis_Armstrong_Autograph.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Louis_Armstrong_NYWTS_3.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Hatter_Sam_Taft_with_Louis_Armstrong.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Louis_Armstrong_and_Grace_Kelly_on_the_set_of_%22High_Society%22%2C_1956.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Louis_Armstrong_NYWTS_4.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Adi_Holzer_Werksverzeichnis_899_Satchmo_%28Louis_Armstrong%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Flag_of_New_Orleans%2C_Louisiana.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Armstrong-Alassio.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Flag_of_New_Orleans%2C_Louisiana.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Louis_armstrong_producers_showcase_1956.JPG"]	f	90%
281	Richard Wagner	Wilhelm Richard Wagner (/ˈvɑːɡnər/; German: [ˈʁiçaʁt ˈvaːɡnɐ]; 22 May 1813 – 13 February 1883) was a German composer, theatre director, polemicist, and conductor who is primarily known for his operas (or, as some of his later works were later known, "music dramas"). Unlike most opera composers, Wagner wrote both the libretto and the music for each of his stage works. Initially establishing his reputation as a composer of works in the romantic vein of Weber and Meyerbeer, Wagner revolutionised opera through his concept of the Gesamtkunstwerk ("total work of art"), by which he sought to synthesise the poetic, visual, musical and dramatic arts, with music subsidiary to drama, and which was announced in a series of essays between 1849 and 1852. Wagner realised these ideas most fully in the first half of the four-opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelung).\nHis compositions, particularly those of his later period, are notable for their complex textures, rich harmonies and orchestration, and the elaborate use of leitmotifs—musical phrases associated with individual characters, places, ideas or plot elements. His advances in musical language, such as extreme chromaticism and quickly shifting tonal centres, greatly influenced the development of classical music. His Tristan und Isolde is sometimes described as marking the start of modern music.\nWagner had his own opera house built, the Bayreuth Festspielhaus, which embodied many novel design features. It was here that the Ring and Parsifal received their premieres and where his most important stage works continue to be performed in an annual festival run by his descendants. His thoughts on the relative contributions of music and drama in opera were to change again, and he reintroduced some traditional forms into his last few stage works, including Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg (The Mastersingers of Nuremberg).\nUntil his final years, Wagner's life was characterised by political exile, turbulent love affairs, poverty and repeated flight from his creditors. His controversial writings on music, drama and politics have attracted extensive comment in recent decades, especially where they express antisemitic sentiments. The effect of his ideas can be traced in many of the arts throughout the 20th century; their influence spread beyond composition into conducting, philosophy, literature, the visual arts and theatre.	\N	\N	\N	http://inmozartsfootsteps.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/wagner9.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wagner	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/06/Photo_of_Gustav_Mahler_by_Moritz_N%C3%A4hr_01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Wagnerbruhl.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Wagnerclic.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/WahnfriedBayreuth11.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/People_icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Office-book.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Richard_Wagner%2C_Paris%2C_1861.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/RichardWagner.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Richard_Wagner_c.1840.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Richard_Wagner_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Richard_and_Cosima_Wagner.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Richard_Wagners_Steckbrief_1849.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Siegfried_leitmotif.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Ring22.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Gill_Wagner.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Festspielhaus_Bayreuth_1900.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Mathilde1850.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Hanslick.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/Betz_Franz.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Der_fliegende_Holl%C3%A4nder.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/De_20_jarige_Ludwig_II_in_kroningsmantel_door_Ferdinand_von_Piloty_1865.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Nietzsche1882.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Minna.jpg"]	f	80%
259	Napoleon	Napoleon Bonaparte (French: Napoléon Bonaparte [napoleɔ̃ bɔnɑpaʁt], Italian: Napoleone Buonaparte; 15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821) was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the latter stages of the French Revolution and its associated wars in Europe.\nAs Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 to 1814. He implemented a wide array of liberal reforms across Europe, including the abolition of feudalism and the spread of religious toleration. His legal code in France, the Napoleonic Code, influenced numerous civil law jurisdictions worldwide. Napoleon is remembered for his role in leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won the majority of his battles and seized control of most of continental Europe in a quest for personal power and to spread the ideals of the French Revolution. Widely regarded as one of the greatest commanders in history, his campaigns are studied at military academies worldwide. He remains one of the most studied political and military leaders in all of history.\nNapoleon was born in Corsica in a family of noble Italian ancestry that had settled in Corsica in the 16th century. He spoke French with a heavy Corsican accent. Well-educated, he rose to prominence under the French First Republic and led successful campaigns against the enemies of the French revolution who set up the First and Second Coalitions, most notably his campaigns in Italy.\nHe took power in a coup d'état in 1799 and installed himself as First Consul. In 1804 he made himself emperor of the French people. He fought a series of wars —the Napoleonic Wars—that involved complex coalitions for and against him. After a streak of victories, France secured a dominant position in continental Europe, and Napoleon maintained the French sphere of influence through the formation of extensive alliances and the elevation of friends and family members to rule other European countries as French vassal states.\nThe Peninsular War (1807–14) and the French invasion of Russia in 1812 marked major military failures. His Grande Armée was badly damaged and never fully recovered. In 1813, the Sixth Coalition defeated his forces at the Battle of Leipzig and his enemies invaded France. Napoleon was forced to abdicate and go in exile to the Italian island of Elba. In 1815 he escaped and returned to power, but he was finally defeated at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. He spent the last 6 years of his life in confinement by the British on the island of Saint Helena. An autopsy concluded he died of stomach cancer but there has been debate about the cause of his death, and some scholars have speculated he was a victim of arsenic poisoning.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Napoleons_retreat_from_moscow.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Napoleon_in_1806.PNG",

287	Industrial Revolution	The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. This transition included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, improved efficiency of water power, the increasing use of steam power and the development of machine tools. It also included the change from wood and other bio-fuels to coal.\nTextiles were the dominant industry of the Industrial Revolution in terms of employment, value of output and capital invested. Textiles were also the first to use modern production methods.\nThe Industrial Revolution marks a major turning point in history; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. In particular, average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth. In the words of Nobel Prize winner Robert E. Lucas, Jr., "For the first time in history, the living standards of the masses of ordinary people have begun to undergo sustained growth ... Nothing remotely like this economic behavior is mentioned by the classical economists, even as a theoretical possibility."\nThe Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and within a few decades spread to Western Europe and the United States. The period of time covered by the Industrial Revolution varies with different historians. Eric Hobsbawm held that it 'broke out' in Britain in the 1780s and was not fully felt until the 1830s or 1840s, while T. S. Ashton held that it occurred roughly between 1760 and 1830.\nSome 20th-century historians such as John Clapham and Nicholas Crafts have argued that the process of economic and social change took place gradually and the term revolution is a misnomer. This is still a subject of debate among historians. GDP per capita was broadly stable before the Industrial Revolution and the emergence of the modern capitalist economy. The Industrial Revolution began an era of per-capita economic growth in capitalist economies. Economic historians are in agreement that the onset of the Industrial Revolution is the most important event in the history of humanity since the domestication of animals and plants.\nThe First Industrial Revolution evolved into the Second Industrial Revolution in the transition years between 1840 and 1870, when technological and economic progress continued with the increasing adoption of steam-powered boats, ships and railways, the large scale manufacture of machine tools and the increasing use of machinery in steam powered factories.	\N	\N	\N	http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yMH-RXbyoD8/TOBC83Le1GI/AAAAAAAAFoQ/JJhCCT5937w/s1600/industrial-revolution.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Watt_James_von_Breda.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/58/Padlock-olive.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Vereinigte_Ostindische_Compagnie_bond.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Wright_of_Derby%2C_The_Orrery.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Middletown_milling_machine_1818--001.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Mule-jenny.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Maquina_vapor_Watt_ETSIIM.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Marshall%27s_flax-mill%2C_Holbeck%2C_Leeds_-_interior_-_c.1800.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Maudslay_screw-cutting_lathes_of_circa_1797_and_1800.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Middleton_Colliery_1814.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Horse_Railway_in_Coal_Mine.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Ironbridge_6.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Joseph_whitworth.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Makadam.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/ConverterB.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Coaltub.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Crystal_Palace_interior.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Cottonopolis1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Emblem-money.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Dore_London.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Graph_rel_share_world_manuf_1750_1900_02.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/FrameBreaking-1812.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Historic_world_GDP_per_capita.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Hartmann_Maschinenhalle_1868_%2801%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Thamestunnel.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Spinning_jenny.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/SlaterMill.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Savery-engine.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Reverberatory_furnace_diagram.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Philipp_Jakob_Loutherbourg_d._J._002.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Opening_Liverpool_and_Manchester_Railway.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Newcomens_Dampfmaschine_aus_Meyers_1890.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Nasmyth_milling_machine_1829-1830--001.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Bethlehem_Steel.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Belgium_resources_1968.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Chartist_meeting%2C_Kennington_Common.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Bois-du-Luc_CM3JPG.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Affiche_1905.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/William_Bell_Scott_-_Iron_and_Coal.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Barton-on-Irwell_11.05.02R.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/BASF_Werk_Ludwigshafen_1881.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Child_workers_in_Millville%2C_NJ.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Chassis_%C3%A0_molette_de_Crachet_%C3%A0_Frameries_vue_large.JPG"]	f	cover
271	Percy Bysshe Shelley	Percy Bysshe Shelley (/ˈpɜrsi ˈbɪʃ ˈʃɛli/; 4 August 1792 – 8 July 1822) was one of the major English Romantic poets and is regarded by critics as amongst the finest lyric poets in the English language. A radical in his poetry as well as his political and social views, Shelley did not achieve fame during his lifetime, but recognition for his poetry grew steadily following his death. Shelley was a key member of a close circle of visionary poets and writers that included Lord Byron; Leigh Hunt; Thomas Love Peacock; and his own second wife, Mary Shelley, the author of Frankenstein.\nShelley is perhaps best known for such classic poems as Ozymandias, Ode to the West Wind, To a Skylark, Music, When Soft Voices Die, The Cloud and The Masque of Anarchy. His other major works include long, visionary poems such as Queen Mab (later reworked as The Daemon of the World), Alastor, The Revolt of Islam, Adonaïs, the unfinished work The Triumph of Life; and the visionary verse dramas The Cenci (1819) and Prometheus Unbound (1820).\nHis close circle of admirers, however, included some progressive thinkers of the day, including his future father-in-law, the philosopher William Godwin. Though Shelley's poetry and prose output remained steady throughout his life, most publishers and journals declined to publish his work for fear of being arrested themselves for blasphemy or sedition. Shelley did not live to see success and influence, although these reach down to the present day not only in literature, but in major movements in social and political thought.\nShelley became an idol of the next three or four generations of poets, including important Victorian and Pre-Raphaelite poets such as Robert Browning and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. He was admired by Oscar Wilde, Thomas Hardy, George Bernard Shaw, Bertrand Russell, W. B. Yeats, Karl Marx, Upton Sinclair and Isadora Duncan. Henry David Thoreau's civil disobedience was apparently influenced by Shelley's non-violence in protest and political action.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Portrait_of_Percy_Bysshe_Shelley_by_Curran,_1819.jpg/244px-Portrait_of_Percy_Bysshe_Shelley_by_Curran,_1819.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Bysshe_Shelley	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Shelley_Memorial%2C_University_College%2C_Oxford.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/RothwellMaryShelley.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/WilliamGodwinNorthcote.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Marywollstonecraft.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/The_Funeral_of_Shelley_by_Louis_Edouard_Fournier.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/MaryShelley.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Keats_Shelly_Museum%2C_Spanish_Steps%2C_Rome.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Percy_Bysshe_Shelley_by_Alfred_Clint_crop.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Percy_Bysshe_Shelley_by_Alfred_Clint.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Autograph_Percy_Bysshe_Shelley.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Shelly%27stoneRome.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Joseph_Severn_-_Posthumous_Portrait_of_Shelley_Writing_Prometheus_Unbound_1845.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/HistorySixWeeksTourMap.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Quill_and_ink.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Autograph_Percy_Bysshe_Shelley.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg"]	f	75%
280	Franz Liszt	Franz Liszt, T.O.S.F. (German: [fʁant͡s lɪst]; Hungarian: Liszt Ferencz; October 22, 1811 – July 31, 1886), in modern use Liszt Ferenc (Hungarian pronunciation: [list ˈfɛrɛnt͡s]); from 1859 to 1867 officially Franz Ritter von Liszt, was a 19th-century Hungarian composer, virtuoso pianist, conductor, teacher and Franciscan tertiary.\nLiszt gained renown in Europe during the early nineteenth century for his virtuosic skill as a pianist. He was said by his contemporaries to have been the most technically advanced pianist of his age, and in the 1840s he was considered by some to be perhaps the greatest pianist of all time. Liszt was also a well-known and influential composer, piano teacher and conductor. He was a benefactor to other composers, including Richard Wagner, Hector Berlioz, Camille Saint-Saëns, Edvard Grieg and Alexander Borodin.\nAs a composer, Liszt was one of the most prominent representatives of the "Neudeutsche Schule" ("New German School"). He left behind an extensive and diverse body of work in which he influenced his forward-looking contemporaries and anticipated some 20th-century ideas and trends. Some of his most notable contributions were the invention of the symphonic poem, developing the concept of thematic transformation as part of his experiments in musical form and making radical departures in harmony. He also played an important role in popularizing a wide array of music by transcribing it for piano.	\N	\N	\N	http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-K5pPYvpDQ_8/TqRoFx8xScI/AAAAAAAAJUg/rMMaboR2E3I/s320/Liszt.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Liszt	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Liszt_at_the_Piano.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Liszt_Ferenc_Zenem%C5%B1v%C3%A9szeti_Egyetem_2013-ban_fel%C3%BAj%C3%ADtott_homlokzata.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Wilhelm_von_Kaulbach_001.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/NiccoloPaganini.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Franz_Liszt_1858.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/FranzLisztPiano.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Franz_Liszt_by_Nadar%2C_March_1886.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Franz_Liszt_by_Herman_Biow-_1843.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Ary_Scheffer_-_Franz_Liszt.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Maria_Anna_Lager.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Bechstein_Schriftzug.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Barabas-liszt.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Liszt-Villa_d%27Este.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Liszt-1870.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Office-book.svg"]	f	contain

In numerous successful wars he expanded the Tsardom into a huge empire that became a major European power. According to historian James Cracraft, he led a cultural revolution that replaced some of the traditionalist and medieval social and political system with a modern, scientific, Europe-oriented, and rationalist system.\nImperial title of Peter the Great was the following:	\N	\N	\N	http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wRGUVPoQB8Q/TTRxYVmXqxI/AAAAAAAACPc/owGoDiPnl5g/s1600/Peter-the-Great_1.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_the_Great	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Translation_to_english_arrow.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Young_Peter_the_Great_parsuna.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/ZauerveydNA_Petr1UsmirDA19.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/62/PD-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Nikitin_peter_deathbed.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Peter_benois.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Peter_I_by_Kneller.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Peter_order.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Peter_der-Grosse_1838.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Peter_the_Great_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Peter_the_Great_Interrogating_the_Tsarevich_Alexei_Petrovich.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Sankt_Petersburg_Peter_der_Grosse_2005_a.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Crown_of_Saint_Edward_Heraldry.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Coat_of_arms_of_Russia_%28XV_Century%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Imperial_Coat_of_arms_of_Russia_%2817th_century%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Flag_of_Saint_Petersburg_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Antokolski_Peter_the_Great.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Capture_of_Azov_1696.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Bronze_Horseman_and_St%27Isaac%27s_cathedral_1890-1900.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ec/Peter_the_Great_tomb.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Lomonosov_Poltava_1762_1764.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Lesser_Coat_of_Arms_of_Russian_Empire.svg"]	f	50%
108	Mongols	The Mongols, or Mongolic peoples, are a Central and Northern Asian (Inner Asia) ethno-linguistic group. Although the largest Mongolic group consists of the inhabitants of Mongolia, they also live as minorities across Northern Asia, including in Russia, China, and many of the former Soviet Union states. Mongolic peoples belonging to the Buryat ethnic group live predominantly in what is now the autonomous Republic of Buryatia, Russia. In China, they live mainly either in Inner Mongolia or, less commonly, in Xinjiang. Mongolic peoples are bound together by a common culture and language, a group of related tongues known as Mongolic

109	Baroque	The Baroque (US /bəˈroʊk/ or UK /bəˈrɒk/) is a period of artistic style that used exaggerated motion and clear, easily interpreted detail to produce drama, tension, exuberance, and grandeur in sculpture, painting, architecture, literature, dance, and music. The style began around 1600 in Rome, Italy and spread to most of Europe.\nThe popularity and success of the Baroque style was encouraged by the Roman Catholic Church, which had decided at the time of the Council of Trent, in response to the Protestant Reformation, that the arts should communicate religious themes in direct and emotional involvement. The aristocracy also saw the dramatic style of Baroque architecture and art as a means of impressing visitors and expressing triumph, power and control. Baroque palaces are built around an entrance of courts, grand staircases and reception rooms of sequentially increasing opulence.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Prager_Burg_-_Nikolauskirche_Kuppel.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Trevi_Fountain%2C_Rome%2C_Italy_2_-_May_2007.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Pietro_Domenico_Oliviero_-_The_Royal_Theater_in_Turin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Santa_Maria_della_Vittoria_-_4.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/German_-_Brooch_of_an_African_-_Walters_57887_-_Back.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Estasi_di_Santa_Teresa.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Johann_Sebastian_Bach.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Haendel.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Aeneas%27_Flight_from_Troy_by_Federico_Barocci.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Sant%27Andrea.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Elewacja_wschodnia.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/BR%C3%BCHLschloss6.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/JosefaObidos4.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Pierre_Le_Gros_%28II%29_-_The_Death_of_St_Stanislas_Kostka_-_WGA12562.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Peter_Paul_Rubens_-_The_Adoration_of_the_Magi_-_WGA20244.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg"]	f	cover
326	Giuseppe Garibaldi	Giuseppe Garibaldi (Italian: [dʒuˈzɛppe ɡariˈbaldi]; July 4, 1807 – June 2, 1882) was an Italian general and politician who played a large role in the history of Italy and the world. He is considered, with Camillo Cavour, Victor Emmanuel II and Giuseppe Mazzini, as one of Italy's "fathers of the fatherland".\nGaribaldi was a central figure in the Italian Risorgimento, since he personally commanded and fought in many military campaigns that led eventually to the formation of a unified Italy. He was appointed general by the provisional government of Milan in 1848, General of the Roman Republic in 1849 by the Minister of War, and led the Expedition of the Thousand on behalf and with the consent of Victor Emmanuel II.\nHe has been called the "Hero of Two Worlds" because of his military enterprises in Brazil, Uruguay and Europe. These earned him a considerable reputation in Italy and abroad, aided by exceptional international media coverage at the time. Many of the greatest intellectuals of his time, such as Victor Hugo, Alexandre Dumas, and George Sand showered him with admiration. The United Kingdom and the United States helped him a great deal, offering him financial and military support in difficult circumstances.\nIn the popular telling of his story, he is associated with the red shirts worn by his volunteers in lieu of a uniform.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Garibaldi	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Portrait_of_General_Giuseppe_Garibaldi%2C_published_by_Vanity_Fair_on_15th_June_1878%2C.jpg",

311	East India Company	The East India Company (EIC), originally chartered as the Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading into the East Indies, and more properly called the Honourable East India Company, was an English, and later (from 1707) British joint-stock company, formed to pursue trade with the East Indies but that ended up trading mainly with the Indian subcontinent, Qing Dynasty China, North-West Frontier Province and Balochistan. The Company rose to account for half of the world's trade, particularly trade in basic commodities that included cotton, silk, indigo dye, salt, saltpetre, tea, and opium. The Company also ruled the beginnings of the British Empire in India.\nThe Company received a Royal Charter from Queen Elizabeth in 1600, making it the oldest among several similarly formed European East India Companies. Wealthy merchants and aristocrats owned the Company's shares. The government owned no shares and had only indirect control. The Company eventually came to rule large areas of India with its own private armies, exercising military power and assuming administrative functions. Company rule in India effectively began in 1757 after the Battle of Plassey and lasted until 1858 when, following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Government of India Act 1858 led to the British Crown to assume direct control of India in the new British Raj.\nThe company was dissolved in 1874 as a result of the East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act passed one year earlier, as the Government of India Act had by then rendered it vestigial, powerless, and obsolete. The official government machinery of British India had assumed its governmental functions and absorbed its presidency armies.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Tipu_death.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Rear_view_of_the_East_India_Company%27s_Factory_at_Cossimbazar.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Reddragonship.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Shah_Alam_II%2C_1790s.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Jameslancaster.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/NatGeog1917EastIndiaCompanyFlag.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/One_Rupee_East_India_Company.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Potassium_nitrate.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Coat_of_arms_of_the_East_India_Company.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Captain_Every_%28Works_of_Daniel_Defoe%29.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/East_India_House_THS_1817_edited.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Destroying_Chinese_war_junks%2C_by_E._Duncan_%281843%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Every_engaging_the_Great_Mogul%27s_Ship.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/East_India_House_by_Thomas_Malton_the_Younger.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Flag_of_the_British_East_India_Company_%281801%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Flag_of_the_British_East_India_Company_%281707%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Jahangir_investing_a_courtier_with_a_robe_of_honour_watched_by_Sir_Thomas_Roe%2C_English_ambassador_to_the_court_of_Jahangir_at_Agra_from_1615-18%2C_and_others.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Henry_Every.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/British_East_India_Company_Flag_from_Lens.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/British_East_India_Company_Flag_from_Laurie.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/British_East_India_Company_flag.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/British_East_India_Company_Flag_from_Rees.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Addiscombe_Seminary_photo_c.1859.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/British_East_India_Company_Flag_from_Downman.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Boston_Tea_Party_Currier_colored.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/British_Indian_Empire_1909_Imperial_Gazetteer_of_India.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/British_Empire_1897.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Clive.jpg"]	f	cover
39	Martin Luther	Martin Luther OSA (German: [ˈmaɐ̯tiːn ˈlʊtɐ] ( ); 10 November 1483 – 18 February 1546) was a German monk, Catholic priest, professor of theology and seminal figure of a reform movement in 16th century Christianity, subsequently known as the Protestant Reformation. He strongly disputed the claim that freedom from God's punishment for sin could be purchased with monetary values. He confronted indulgence salesman Johann Tetzel, a Dominican friar, with his Ninety-Five Theses in 1517. His refusal to retract all of his writings at the demand of Pope Leo X in 1520 and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Worms in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by the Pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the Emperor.\nLuther taught that salvation and subsequently eternity in heaven is not earned by good deeds but is received only as a free gift of God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ as redeemer from sin and subsequently eternity in Hell. His theology challenged the authority of the Pope of the Roman Catholic Church by teaching that the Bible is the only source of divinely revealed knowledge from God and opposed sacerdotalism by considering all baptized Christians to be a holy priesthood. Those who identify with these, and all of Luther's wider teachings, are called Lutherans even though Luther insisted on Christian as the only acceptable name for individuals who professed Christ.\nHis translation of the Bible into the vernacular (instead of Latin) made it more accessible, which had a tremendous impact on the church and on German culture. It fostered the development of a standard version of the German language, added several principles to the art of translation, and influenced the writing of an English translation, the Tyndale Bible. His hymns influenced the development of singing in churches. His marriage to Katharina von Bora set a model for the practice of clerical marriage, allowing Protestant priests to marry.\nIn two of his later works, Luther expressed antagonistic views toward Jews, writing that Jewish synagogues and homes should be destroyed, their money confiscated, and liberty curtailed. These statements and their influence on antisemitism have contributed to his controversial status. Martin Luther died in 1546, still convinced of his Reformation theology, and with his decree of excommunication by Pope Leo X still effective. On his deathbed, Luther was asked, 'Are you ready to die trusting in your Lord Jesus Christ and to confess the doctrine which you have taught in his name?'. He answered, 'Yes' before taking his final breath.	\N	\N	\N	http://sheg.stanford.edu/upload/v2images/WORLD/MartinLuther.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/%D0%9B%D1%8E%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80_%D0%B2_%D0%92%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BC%D1%81%D0%B5.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/OsmanenDeutscheKavallerie-1-.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/MartinLutherWindow.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Martin_Luther.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Martin_Luther_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Martin_Luther_by_Lucas_Cranach_der_%C3%84ltere.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Lutherbibel.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Lutherrose.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Luthers_Sterbehaus_Eisleben.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Luthertombstoneunderaltar.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a3/Luther_death-hand_mask.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/90/EinFesteBurg.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Jeorg_Breu_Elder_A_Question_to_a_Mintmaker_c1500.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Hans_and_Margarethe_Luther%2C_by_Lucas_Cranach_the_Elder.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Kirchenordnung_Mecklenburg_1650.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Judensau-Wittenberg.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Lucas_Cranach_d.%C3%84._-_Martin_Luther%2C_1528_%28Veste_Coburg%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Lucas_Cranach_d.%C3%84._-_Bildnis_Luthers_als_Junker_J%C3%B6rg.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Luther-vor-Cajetan.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Luckau_Nikolaikirche_Abendmahlsbild.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Luther_with_tonsure.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/LutherWritings%26Portrait1581.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Wittenberg_Thesentuer_Schlosskirche.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Wittenberg_Lutherhaus.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Wartburg_Eisenach_DSCN3512.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/WartburgLutherstube1900.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Statue_of_Martin_Luther%2C_St._Mary%27s_Church%2C_Mitte%2C_Berlin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Sound-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Portrait_of_Martin_Luther_as_an_Augustinian_Monk.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Ein%27_Feste_Burg.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Cranach_Katharina_von_Bora.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Epi_Michael-Meienburg-1555.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/En-Martin_Luther.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/1543_On_the_Jews_and_Their_Lies_by_Martin_Luther.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Bulla-contra-errores.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Bildbauernkrieg.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Gloriole_blur.svg"]	f	cover
156	Ptolemy	Claudius Ptolemy (/ˈtɒləmi/; Greek: Κλαύδιος Πτολεμαῖος, Klaudios Ptolemaios, pronounced [kláwdios ptolɛmɛ́ːos]; Latin: Claudius Ptolemaeus; c. AD 90 – c. AD 168) was a Greco-Roman writer of Alexandria, known as a mathematician, astronomer, geographer, astrologer, and poet of a single epigram in the Greek Anthology. He lived in the city of Alexandria in the Roman province of Egypt, wrote in Greek, and held Roman citizenship. Beyond that, few reliable details of his life are known. His birthplace has been given as Ptolemais Hermiou in the Thebaid in an uncorroborated statement by the 14th century astronomer Theodore Meliteniotes. This is a very late attestation, however, and there is no other reason to suppose that he ever lived anywhere else than Alexandria, where he died around AD 168.\nPtolemy was the author of several scientific treatises, three of which were of continuing importance to later Islamic and European science. The first is the astronomical treatise now known as the Almagest (in Greek, Ἡ Μεγάλη Σύνταξις, "The Great Treatise", originally Μαθηματικὴ Σύνταξις, "Mathematical Treatise"). The second is the Geography, which is a thorough discussion of the geographic knowledge of the Greco-Roman world. The third is the astrological treatise known sometimes in Greek as the Apotelesmatika (Ἀποτελεσματικά), more commonly in Greek as the Tetrabiblos (Τετράβιβλος "Four books"), and in Latin as the Quadripartitum (or four books) in which he attempted to adapt horoscopic astrology to the Aristotelian natural philosophy of his day.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/People_icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Padlock-silver-light.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/PtolemyWorldMap.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Ptolemaeus.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/BlankMap-World6.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/La_Cosmographie_de_Claude_Ptolem%C3%A9e.djvu", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Claudius_Ptolemy-_The_World.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Ptolemy_urania.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/Ptolemy_16century.jpg"]	f	cover
112	Palace of Versailles	The Palace of Versailles (English /vɛərˈsaɪ/ vair-SY or /vərˈsaɪ/ vər-SY; French: [vɛʁˈsɑj]), or simply Versailles, is a royal château in Versailles in the Île-de-France region of France. In French it is the Château de Versailles.\nWhen the château was built, Versailles was a country village; today, however, it is a wealthy suburb of Paris, some 20 kilometres southwest of the French capital. The court of Versailles was the center of political power in France from 1682, when Louis XIV moved from Paris, until the royal family was forced to return to the capital in October 1789 after the beginning of the French Revolution. Versailles is therefore famous not only as a building, but as a symbol of the system of absolute monarchy of the Ancien Régime.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Versailles	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0c/Red_pog.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Vue_a%C3%A9rienne_du_domaine_de_Versailles_par_ToucanWings_-_Creative_Commons_By_Sa_3.0_-_073.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Wernerprokla.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Versailles_Plan_Jean_Delagrive.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Versailles_Queen%27s_Chamber.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Versailles_chateau.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/Versaillespanoraama2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Royal_Standard_of_the_Kingdom_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/The_Grand_Trianon_Castle_Interios.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/The_Grand_Trianon_Castle_in_Summer.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Versailles-Chateau-VueJardins1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Chateau_Versailles_Galerie_des_Glaces.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Louis14-H.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/Ile-de-France_jms.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Palace_of_Versailles.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Orangerie.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Paris-metropolitan-area-symbol.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Palace_of_Versailles.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Royal_Standard_of_the_Kingdom_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/Peter_Stehlik_2013.04.22_Panorama_1A.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Schloss-Versailles.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/R%C3%A9ception_du_Grand_Cond%C3%A9_%C3%A0_Versailles_%28Jean-L%C3%A9on_G%C3%A9r%C3%B4me%2C_1878%29.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Zuidgevel_Corps_de_logis_rond_1675_Anonieme_schilder.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/William_Orpen_-_The_Signing_of_Peace_in_the_Hall_of_Mirrors%2C_Versailles.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/7_Versailles_nog_zonder_spiegelzaal.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/4_Versailles_IV_de_envelope_van_1674_met_de_vogelkooien.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Carnival_versions_of_Louis_XIV_and_Marie-Antoinette_in_front_of_Versailles_Palace.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Adam_Frans_van_der_Meulen_-_Construction_of_the_Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Versailles_-_WGA15115.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/1920s_Leconte_Map_of_Paris_w-Monuments_and_Map_of_Versailles_-_Geographicus_-_ParisVersailles-leconte-1920s_-_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/3_Versailles_III_als_in_1668.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/1_Versailles_I_als_in_1623.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Heim%2C_Fran%C3%A7ois-Joseph_-_Louis-Philippe_Opening_the_Galerie_des_Batailles_-_1837.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/GrandAppartReine-Versailles.jpg"]	f	cover
185	Mercantilism	Mercantilism is an economic theory and practice common in Europe from the 16th to the 18th century that promoted governmental regulation of a nation’s economy for the purpose of augmenting state power at the expense of rival national powers. It was the economic counterpart of political absolutism. It includes a national economic policy aimed at accumulating monetary reserves through a positive balance of trade, especially of finished goods. Mercantilism dominated Western European economic policy and discourse from the 16th to late-18th centuries. Mercantilism was a cause of frequent European wars and also motivated colonial expansion. Mercantilist theory varied in sophistication from one writer to another and evolved over time. High tariffs, especially on manufactured goods, are an almost universal feature of mercantilist policy. Other policies have included:\nBuilding a network of overseas colonies;\nForbidding colonies to trade with other nations;\nMonopolizing markets with staple ports;\nBanning the export of gold and silver, even for payments;\nForbidding trade to be carried in foreign ships;\nExport subsidies;\nPromoting manufacturing with research or direct subsidies;\nLimiting wages;\nMaximizing the use of domestic resources;\nRestricting domestic consumption with non-tariff barriers to trade.\nMercantilism in its simplest form was bullionism, but mercantilist writers emphasized the circulation of money and rejected hoarding. Their emphasis on monetary metals accords with current ideas regarding the money supply, such as the stimulative effect of a growing money supply. Specie concerns have since been rendered moot by fiat money and floating exchange rates. In time, the heavy emphasis on money was supplanted by industrial policy, accompanied by a shift in focus from the capacity to carry on wars to promoting general prosperity. Mature neomercantilist theory recommends selective high tariffs for "infant" industries or to promote the mutual growth of countries through national industrial specialization[citation needed].\nThe term "mercantilism" was coined by its foremost critic Adam Smith. While many nations practised it, one leading exemplar was France, the economically most important state, where King Louis XIV followed the guidance of Jean Baptiste Colbert, his controller general of finances (1662-83). They were determined that the state should rule in the economic realm as it did in the diplomatic, and that the interests of the state as identified by the king were superior to those of merchants and everyone else. The goal of economic policies was to build up the state, especially in an age of incessant warfare, and the state should look for ways to strengthen the economy and weaken foreign adversaries.\n\n	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/De_slag_bij_Terheide_-_The_Battle_of_Schevening_-_August_10_1653_%28Willem_van_de_Velde_I%2C_1657%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Jean-Baptiste_Colbert.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Gdpercapita.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/SingaporePort1.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Lorrain.seaport.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/AdamSmith.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Emblem-money.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Canaletto_Return_of_the_Bucentoro_to_the_Molo_on_Ascension_Day%2C_1732._Royal_Collection._Windsor..jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Triangle_trade2.png"]	f	cover
358	Existentialism	Existentialism is a term applied to the work of certain late 19th- and 20th-century philosophers who, despite profound doctrinal differences, shared the belief that philosophical thinking begins with the human subject—not merely the thinking subject, but the acting, feeling, living human individual. In existentialism, the individual's starting point is characterized by what has been called "the existential attitude", or a sense of disorientation and confusion in the face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world. Many existentialists have also regarded traditional systematic or academic philosophies, in both style and content, as too abstract and remote from concrete human experience.\nSøren Kierkegaard is generally considered to have been the first existentialist philosopher, though he did not use the term existentialism. He proposed that each individual—not society or religion—is solely responsible for giving meaning to life and living it passionately and sincerely ("authentically"). Existentialism became popular in the years following World War II, and strongly influenced many disciplines besides philosophy, including theology, drama, art, literature, and psychology.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Sartre_and_de_Beauvoir_at_Balzac_Memorial.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Albert_Camus%2C_gagnant_de_prix_Nobel%2C_portrait_en_buste%2C_pos%C3%A9_au_bureau%2C_faisant_face_%C3%A0_gauche%2C_cigarette_de_tabagisme.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/People_icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Kierkegaard-Dostoyevsky-Nietzsche-Sartre.jpg"]	f	cover
346	Charles Darwin	Charles Robert Darwin, FRS (12 February 1809 – 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist and geologist, best known for his contributions to evolutionary theory. He established that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors, and in a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding.\nDarwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species, overcoming scientific rejection of earlier concepts of transmutation of species. By the 1870s the scientific community and much of the general public had accepted evolution as a fact. However, many favoured competing explanations and it was not until the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution. In modified form, Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining the diversity of life.\nDarwin's early interest in nature led him to neglect his medical education at the University of Edinburgh; instead, he helped to investigate marine invertebrates. Studies at the University of Cambridge encouraged his passion for natural science. His five-year voyage on HMS Beagle established him as an eminent geologist whose observations and theories supported Charles Lyell's uniformitarian ideas, and publication of his journal of the voyage made him famous as a popular author.\nPuzzled by the geographical distribution of wildlife and fossils he collected on the voyage, Darwin began detailed investigations and in 1838 conceived his theory of natural selection. Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research and his geological work had priority. He was writing up his theory in 1858 when Alfred Russel Wallace sent him an essay which described the same idea, prompting immediate joint publication of both of their theories. Darwin's work established evolutionary descent with modification as the dominant scientific explanation of diversification in nature. In 1871 he examined human evolution and sexual selection in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, followed by The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. His research on plants was published in a series of books, and in his final book, he examined earthworms and their effect on soil.\nDarwin became internationally famous, and his pre-eminence as a scientist was honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey. Darwin has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history.\n\n	\N	\N	\N	http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WVy8kB8CgkQ/T-38IIphQJI/AAAAAAAAAPU/i0GwXvkb0mo/s1600/charlesdarwin.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Voyage_of_the_Beagle-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/HMS_Beagle_by_Conrad_Martens.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Charles_and_William_Darwin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Darwin_tree.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Darwin_letter.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Editorial_cartoon_depicting_Charles_Darwin_as_an_ape_%281871%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Darwins_Thinking_Path.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Man_is_But_a_Worm.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Emma_Darwin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/VanityFair-Darwin2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Charles_Darwin_by_G._Richmond.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Charles_Darwin_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Charles_Darwin_by_Maull_and_Polyblank%2C_1855-crop.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Charles_Darwin_by_Julia_Margaret_Cameron_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/1878_Darwin_photo_by_Leonard_from_Woodall_1884_-_cropped_grayed_partially_cleaned.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Charles_Darwin_1816.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Annie_Darwin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Charles_Robert_Darwin_by_John_Collier.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Charles_Darwin_seated_crop.jpg"]	f	cover
114	Artemisia Gentileschi	Artemisia Gentileschi[needs IPA] (July 8, 1593 – c. 1656) was an Italian Baroque painter, today considered one of the most accomplished painters in the generation following that of Caravaggio. In an era when women painters were not easily accepted by the artistic community or patrons, she was the first woman to become a member of the Accademia di Arte del Disegno in Florence.\nShe painted many pictures of strong and suffering women from myth and the Bible—victims, suicides, warriors—and made it her speciality to paint the Judith story. Her best-known image, Judith Beheading Holofernes (a well-known medieval and baroque subject in art), shows the decapitation of Holofernes, a scene of horrific struggle and blood-letting." That she was a woman painting in the seventeenth century and that she was raped and participated in prosecuting the rapist, long overshadowed her achievements as an artist. For many years she was regarded as a curiosity. Today she is regarded as one of the most progressive and expressionist painters of her generation.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisia_Gentileschi	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Self-portrait_as_the_Allegory_of_Painting_by_Artemisia_Gentileschi.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Orazio_Gentileschi_-_Young_Woman_Playing_a_Violin.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Susanna_and_the_Elders_%281610%29%2C_Artemisia_Gentileschi.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Artemisia_Gentileschi_-_Judith_Beheading_Holofernes_-_WGA8563.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Gentileschi_judith1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/GENTILESCHI_Judith.jpg"]	f	cover
115	El Greco	El Greco, born Doménikos Theotokópoulos (1541 –  7 April 1614), was a painter, sculptor and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. "El Greco" (The Greek) was a nickname, a reference to his national Greek origin, and the artist normally signed his paintings with his full birth name in Greek letters, Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος (Doménikos Theotokópoulos), often adding the word Κρής (Krēs, "Cretan").\nEl Greco was born in Crete, which was at that time part of the Republic of Venice, and the center of Post-Byzantine art. He trained and became a master within that tradition before travelling at age 26 to Venice, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570 he moved to Rome, where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works. During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance. In 1577, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best-known paintings.\nEl Greco's dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El Greco is regarded as a precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism, while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school. He is best known for tortuously elongated figures and often fantastic or phantasmagorical pigmentation, marrying Byzantine traditions with those of Western painting.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Greco	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/El_Greco%2C_The_Vision_of_Saint_John_%281608-1614%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4c/Les_Demoiselles_d%27Avignon.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/RetratodeTheotocopoulos.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Office-book.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/The_Modena_Triptych.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/The_Assumption_of_the_Virgin_1577.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/USA-National_Gallery_of_Art0.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Trinidad_El_Greco2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Wikidata-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/El_Greco_-_Portrait_of_a_Man_-_WGA10554.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/El_Expolio_del_Greco_Catedral_de_Toledo.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/El_Greco_View_of_Toledo.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/El_Greco_-_The_Burial_of_the_Count_of_Orgaz.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Adoration_of_the_Magi.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/ElGreco_signature.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Dormition_El_Greco.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d2/Picasso_Painter_El_Greco.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Julije_Klovic_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/El_greco.JPG"]	f	cover

381	Henrik Ibsen	Henrik Johan Ibsen (Norwegian: [ˈhɛnɾɪk ˈɪpsən]; 20 March 1828 – 23 May 1906) was a major 19th-century Norwegian playwright, theatre director, and poet. He is often referred to as "the father of realism" and is one of the founders of Modernism in theatre. His major works include Brand, Peer Gynt, An Enemy of the People, Emperor and Galilean, A Doll's House, Hedda Gabler, Ghosts, The Wild Duck, Rosmersholm, and The Master Builder. He is the most frequently performed dramatist in the world after Shakespeare, and A Doll's House became the world's most performed play by the early 20th century.\nSeveral of his plays were considered scandalous to many of his era, when European theatre was required to model strict morals of family life and propriety. Ibsen's work examined the realities that lay behind many façades, revealing much that was disquieting to many contemporaries. It utilized a critical eye and free inquiry into the conditions of life and issues of morality. The poetic and cinematic play Peer Gynt, however, has strong surreal elements.\nIbsen is often ranked as one of the truly great playwrights in the European tradition. Richard Hornby describes him as "a profound poetic dramatist—the best since Shakespeare". He is widely regarded as the most important playwright since Shakespeare. He influenced other playwrights and novelists such as George Bernard Shaw, Oscar Wilde, Arthur Miller, James Joyce, Eugene O'Neill and Miroslav Krleža.\nIbsen wrote his plays in Danish (the common written language of Denmark and Norway) and they were published by the Danish publisher Gyldendal. Although most of his plays are set in Norway—often in places reminiscent of Skien, the port town where he grew up—Ibsen lived for 27 years in Italy and Germany, and rarely visited Norway during his most productive years. Born into a merchant family connected to the patriciate of Skien, his dramas were shaped by his family background. He was the father of Prime Minister Sigurd Ibsen.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Ibsen_by_Olrik.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrik_Ibsen	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Ibsen_monogram.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Henrik_Ibsen%27s_signature.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Hedvig_C_Paus2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Henrik_Ibsen_by_Gustav_Borgen_NFB-19778_restored.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Henrik_Ibsen_Vanity_Fair_1901-12-12.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Altenburg2.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Handwriting2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Books-aj.svg_aj_ashton_01.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Ibsen-Dresden01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Henrik_Ibsen_portrait.jpg"]	f	70%
120	Johannes Vermeer	Johannes, Jan or Johan Vermeer (Dutch: [joˈɦɑnəs jɑn vərˈmeːr]; 1632 – December 1675) was a Dutch painter who specialized in domestic interior scenes of middle-class life. Vermeer was a moderately successful provincial genre painter in his lifetime. He seems never to have been particularly wealthy, leaving his wife and children in debt at his death, perhaps because he produced relatively few paintings.\nVermeer worked slowly and with great care, using bright colours and sometimes expensive pigments, with a preference for lapis lazuli and Indian yellow. He is particularly renowned for his masterly treatment and use of light in his work.\nVermeer painted mostly domestic interior scenes. "Almost all his paintings are apparently set in two smallish rooms in his house in Delft; they show the same furniture and decorations in various arrangements and they often portray the same people, mostly women."\nRecognized during his lifetime in Delft and The Hague, his modest celebrity gave way to obscurity after his death; he was barely mentioned in Arnold Houbraken's major source book on 17th-century Dutch painting (Grand Theatre of Dutch Painters and Women Artists), and was thus omitted from subsequent surveys of Dutch art for nearly two centuries. In the 19th century, Vermeer was rediscovered by Gustav Friedrich Waagen and Théophile Thoré-Bürger, who published an essay attributing sixty-six pictures to him, although only thirty-four paintings are universally attributed to him today. Since that time, Vermeer's reputation has grown, and he is now acknowledged as one of the greatest painters of the Dutch Golden Age.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Vermeer	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Leonard_Schenk_001_detail_01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Johannes_Vermeer_-_Het_melkmeisje_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Vermeer-view-of-delft.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Cropped_version_of_Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft_002.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft_011.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/J._VERMEER_-_El_astr%C3%B3nomo_%28Museo_del_Louvre%2C_1688%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/2010-05-15-delft-by-RalfR-13.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/The_Geographer.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Blaeu_1652_-_Delft.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Abraham_Rademaker_-_The_Jesuit_Church_on_the_Oude_Langendijk_in_Delft_-_WGA18594.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Johannes_Vermeer_-_A_Lady_and_Two_Gentlemen_-_WGA24639.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft_025.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft_014.jpg"]	f	cover
121	Polyphony	In music, polyphony is a texture consisting of two or more simultaneous lines of independent melody, as opposed to music with just one voice (monophony) or music with one dominant melodic voice accompanied by chords (homophony).\nWithin the context of the Western musical tradition, the term is usually used to refer to music of the late Middle Ages and Renaissance. Baroque forms such as the fugue, which might be called polyphonic, are usually described instead as contrapuntal. Also, as opposed to the species terminology of counterpoint, polyphony was generally either "pitch-against-pitch" / "point-against-point" or "sustained-pitch" in one part with melismas of varying lengths in another. In all cases the conception was probably what Margaret Bent (1999) calls "dyadic counterpoint", with each part being written generally against one other part, with all parts modified if needed in the end. This point-against-point conception is opposed to "successive composition", where voices were written in an order with each new voice fitting into the whole so far constructed, which was previously assumed.\n\n	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphony	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/A_traditional_male_folk_group_from_Skrapar.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/BachFugueBar.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/BachFugueBar.mid"]	f	cover
123	Recitative	Recitative /ˌrɛsɪtəˈtiːv/, also known by its Italian name "recitativo" ([retʃitaˈtiːvo]), is a style of delivery (much used in operas, oratorios, and cantatas) in which a singer is allowed to adopt the rhythms of ordinary speech. The mostly syllabic recitativo secco ("dry", accompanied only by continuo) is at one end of a spectrum through recitativo accompagnato (using orchestra), the more melismatic arioso, and finally the full-blown aria or ensemble, where the pulse is entirely governed by the music.\nRecitative does not repeat lines as formally composed songs do.

155	Nicolaus Copernicus	Nicolaus Copernicus (Polish:  Mikołaj Kopernik ; German: Nikolaus Kopernikus; 19 February 1473 – 24 May 1543) was a Renaissance mathematician and astronomer who formulated a heliocentric model of the universe which placed the Sun, rather than the Earth, at the center.\nThe publication of Copernicus' book, De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres), just before his death in 1543, is considered a major event in the history of science. It began the Copernican Revolution and contributed importantly to the scientific revolution.\nCopernicus was born and died in Royal Prussia, a region of the Kingdom of Poland since 1466. Copernicus had a doctorate in canon law and, though without degrees, was a physician, polyglot, classics scholar, translator, governor, diplomat, and economist who in 1517 set down a quantity theory of money, a principal concept in economics to the present day, and formulated a version of Gresham's law in 1519, before Gresham.	\N	\N	\N	http://izquotes.com/images/nicolaus-copernicus.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Symokatta_epistole_morales.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Tusi-couple.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Olsztyn-zamek.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Pl-Miko%C5%82aj_Kopernik.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Ptolemeusz_i_Kopernik.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Nicolas_Copernicus_Polish_cropped.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Nicolaus_Copernicus_epitaph.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Nicolaus_Copernicus_signature_%28podpis_Miko%C5%82aja_Kopernika%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Nikolaus_Kopernikus.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/36/Copernico_commemorative_plate.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Jan_Matejko-Astronomer_Copernicus-Conversation_with_God.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a9/Domenico_Maria_Novara_house_location.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Frauenburger_Dom_2010.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Copernicus_Walhalla.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Germany_5_Mark_Silver_Coin_1973_Copernicus_500th_Birthday.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Frombork_-_Wzg%C3%B3rze_katedralne.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/KOS_sarkofag_ze_szcz%C4%85tkami_Kopernika.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Grabmal_Nikolaus_Kopernikus_Frauenburger_Dom_2010.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Krak%C3%B3w_-_Pomnik_Miko%C5%82aja_Kopernika_02.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Nicolai_Copernici_torinensis_De_revolutionibus_orbium_coelestium.djvu", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Mikolaj_Kopernik.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/%C5%81ukasz_Watzenrode.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Copernicus-Boissard.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Copernican_heliocentrism_theory_diagram.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Copernicus.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Copernicus-an-Herzog-Albrecht.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/6_Warszawa_153.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Collegium_Maius_07.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Nicolaus_Copernicus_signature_%28podpis_Miko%C5%82aja_Kopernika%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Copernicus_Tower_in_Frombork.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/CopernicusHouse.jpg"]	f	80%
392	Weimar Republic	The Weimar Republic (German: Weimarer Republik [ˈvaɪmaʁɐ ʁepuˈbliːk] ( )) is the name given by historians to the federal republic and semipresidential representative democracy established in 1919 in Germany to replace the imperial form of government. It is named after Weimar, the city where the constitutional assembly took place. During this period, and well into the succeeding Nazi era, the official name of the state was German Reich (Deutsches Reich), which continued on from the pre-1918 Imperial period.\nFollowing World War I, the republic emerged from the German Revolution in November 1918. In 1919, a national assembly was convened in Weimar, where a new constitution for the German Reich was written, then adopted on 11 August of that same year. In its fourteen years, the Weimar Republic faced numerous problems, including hyperinflation, political extremists (with paramilitaries – both left and right wing) and continuing contentious relationships with the victors of World War I. However, the Weimar Republic successfully reformed the currency, unified tax policies and the railway system and it did eliminate most of the requirements of the Treaty of Versailles, in that Germany never completely met the disarmament requirements, and eventually only paid a small portion of the total reparations required by the treaty, which were reduced twice by restructuring Germany's debt through the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan.\nThe German government during the Weimar Republic era did not respect the Treaty of Versailles that it had been pressured to sign, and various government figures at the time rejected Germany's post-Versailles borders. General Hans von Seeckt (head of the Reichswehr command from 1920 to 1926) supported an alliance between Germany and the Soviet Union to invade and partition Poland between them to restore the German–Russian border of 1914. Gustav Streseman as German foreign minister in 1925 declared that the reincorporation of territories lost to Poland and Danzig in the Treaty of Versailles was a major task of German foreign policy. The Reichswehr Ministry memorandum of 1926 declared its intention to seek the reincorporation of German territory lost to Poland as its first priority, to be followed by the return of the Saar territory, the annexation of Austria, and remilitarization of the Rhineland.\nThe ensuing period of liberal democracy lapsed by 1930, when President Hindenburg assumed dictatorial emergency powers to back the administrations of Chancellors Brüning, Papen, Schleicher and finally Hitler. Between 1930 and 1933 the Great Depression, even worsened by Brüning's policy of deflation, led to a surge in unemployment. It led to the ascent of the nascent Nazi Party and Adolf Hitler in 1933. The legal measures taken by the new Nazi government in February and March 1933, commonly known as the Machtergreifung (seizure of power) meant that the government could legislate contrary to the constitution. The constitution became irrelevant, therefore 1933 is usually seen as the end of the Weimar Republic and the beginning of Hitler's Third Reich.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Coat_of_Arms_of_Germany.svg/500px-Coat_of_Arms_of_Germany.svg.png	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Flagge_Herzogtum_Anhalt.svg",

126	Monophony	In music, monophony is the simplest of textures, consisting of melody without accompanying harmony. This may be realized as just one note at a time, or with the same note duplicated at the octave (such as often when men and women sing together). If an entire melody is played by two or more instruments or sung by a choir with a fixed interval between the voices or in unison, it is also said to be in monophony. Music in which all the notes sung are in unison is called monophonic. Musical texture is determined in song and music by varying components. Songs intersperse monophony, heterophony, polyphony, homophony, or monody elements throughout the melody to create atmosphere and style. Monophony may not have underlying rhythmic textures, and must consist of only a melodic line. The musics of some cultures where there is a melodic line with rhythmic accompaniment must be considered homophony.\nAccording to Ardis Butterfield (1997), monophony "is the dominant mode of the European vernacular genres as well as of Latin song ... in polyphonic works, it remains a central compositional principle." Polyphony has two or more independent melodic voices. Monophony is one voice in music rather like a soliloquy.\n\n	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monophony	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Liber_Usualis_0340b.mid", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Pop_Goes_the_Weasel.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Pange_Lingua_Latin_in_Latin.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Erik_Satie_-_Ogive_No.1.mid", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Gregorian_chant.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Pop_Goes_the_Weasel_melody.PNG"]	f	cover
127	Counterpoint	In music, counterpoint is the relationship between voices that are interdependent harmonically (polyphony) and yet are independent in rhythm and contour.[citation needed] It has been most commonly identified in classical music, strongly developing during the Renaissance and in much of the common practice period, especially in Baroque music. The term originates from the Latin punctus contra punctum meaning "point against point".	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpoint	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Species2.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Species5.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Species2.mid", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5f/Linear_counterpoint_from_Stravinsky%27s_Octet.mid", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Species5.mid", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Species3.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/BachFugueBar.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/BachFugueBar.mid", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Descending_Double_Neighbor_Figure.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Ascending_Double_Neighbor_Figure.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Species3.mid", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Audio_a.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Ascending_Double_Passing_Tone.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Species4.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/55/Linear_counterpoint_from_Stravinsky%27s_Octet.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Species1.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Species1.mid", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Species4.mid"]	f	cover
398	Chiang Kai-shek	Chiang Kai-shek (October 31, 1887 – April 5, 1975) was a Chinese political and military leader who served as the leader of the Republic of China between 1928 and 1975. He is known as Jiang Jieshi (Chiang Chieh-shih, 蔣介石) or Jiang Zhongzheng (Chiang Chung-cheng, 蔣中正) in Standard Chinese. Chiang was an influential member of the Kuomintang (KMT), the Chinese Nationalist Party, and was a close ally of Sun Yat-sen. He became the Commandant of the Kuomintang's Whampoa Military Academy and took Sun's place as leader of the KMT when Sun died in 1925. In 1926, Chiang led the Northern Expedition to unify the country, becoming China's nominal leader. He served as Chairman of the National Military Council of the Nationalist government of the Republic of China (ROC) from 1928 to 1948. Chiang led China in the Second Sino-Japanese War (the Chinese theater of World War II), consolidating power from the party's former regional warlords. Unlike Sun Yat-sen, Chiang Kai-shek was socially conservative, promoting traditional Chinese culture in the New Life Movement and rejecting western democracy and the nationalist democratic socialism that Sun embraced in favour of an authoritarian government.\nChiang's predecessor, Sun Yat-sen, was well-liked and respected by the Communists, but after Sun's death Chiang was not able to maintain good relations with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). A major split between the Nationalists and Communists occurred in 1927; and, under Chiang's leadership, the Nationalists fought a nation-wide civil war against the Communists. After Japan invaded China in 1937, Chiang agreed to a temporary truce with the CCP. Despite some early cooperative military successes against Japan, by the time that the Japanese surrendered in 1945 neither the CCP nor the KMT trusted each other or were actively cooperating.\nAfter American-sponsored attempts to negotiate a coalition government failed in 1946, the Chinese Civil War resumed. The CCP defeated the Nationalists in 1949. Westad says the Communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than Chiang Kai-Shek, and because in his search for a powerful centralized government, Chiang antagonized too many interest groups in China. Furthermore, his party was weakened in the war against Japan. Meanwhile the Communists told different groups, such as peasants, exactly what they wanted to hear, and cloaked themselves in the cover of Chinese Nationalism.\nChiang's government and army retreated to Taiwan, where Chiang imposed martial law and persecuted people critical of his rule in a period known as the "White Terror". After evacuating to Taiwan, Chiang's government continued to declare its intention to retake mainland China.

410	James Joyce	James Augustine Aloysius Joyce (2 February 1882 – 13 January 1941) was an Irish novelist and poet, considered to be one of the most influential writers in the modernist avant-garde of the early 20th century. Joyce is best known for Ulysses (1922), a landmark work in which the episodes of Homer's Odyssey are paralleled in an array of contrasting literary styles, perhaps most prominent among these the stream of consciousness technique he perfected. Other major works are the short-story collection Dubliners (1914), and the novels A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916) and Finnegans Wake (1939). His complete oeuvre also includes three books of poetry, a play, occasional journalism, and his published letters.\nJoyce was born into a middle class family in Dublin, where he excelled as a student at the Jesuit schools Clongowes and Belvedere, then at University College Dublin. In his early twenties he emigrated permanently to continental Europe, living in Trieste, Paris and Zurich. Though most of his adult life was spent abroad, Joyce's fictional universe does not extend far beyond Dublin, and is populated largely by characters who closely resemble family members, enemies and friends from his time there; Ulysses in particular is set with precision in the streets and alleyways of the city. Shortly after the publication of Ulysses he elucidated this preoccupation somewhat, saying, "For myself, I always write about Dublin, because if I can get to the heart of Dublin I can get to the heart of all the cities of the world. In the particular is contained the universal."	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joyce	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Revolutionary_Joyce_Better_Contrast.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e5/Dubliners_title_page.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c5/Order_form_for_ulysses.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/82/CBI_-_SERIES_C_-_TEN_POUND_NOTE.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/James_Joyce_by_Alex_Ehrenzweig%2C_1915_restored.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/James_Joyce_birth_and_baptismal_certificate.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/James_Joyce_with_Sylvia_Beach_at_Shakespeare_%26_Co_Paris_1920.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/James_Joyce_signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Grave_James_Joyce.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/James_Joyce_age_six%2C_1888.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/James-Joyce-Stephens-Green.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Joyce_oconnell_dublin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Jamesjoyce_tuohy-ohne.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Z%C3%BCrich_-_James_Joice_Plateau_-_Brunnen_IMG_1211.JPG"]	f	cover
128	Hymn	A hymn is a type of song, usually religious, specifically written for the purpose of praise, adoration or prayer, and typically addressed to a deity or deities, or to a prominent figure or personification. The word hymn derives from Greek ὕμνος (hymnos), which means "a song of praise". Collections of hymns are known as hymnals or hymn books.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymn	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/God_Rest_You_Merry%2C_Gentlemen.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/A_mighty_fortress_%28Bass_vocals%29.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Battle_Hymn_of_the_Republic%2C_Frank_C._Stanley%2C_Elise_Stevenson.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/ChristianitySymbolWhite.PNG"]	f	cover
423	The Blitz	The Blitz (from German, "lightning") was the period of sustained strategic bombing of the United Kingdom by Nazi Germany during the Second World War.\nBetween 7 September 1940 and 21 May 1941 there were major aerial raids (attacks in which more than 100 tonnes of high explosives were dropped) on 16 British cities. Over a period of 267 days (almost 37 weeks), London was attacked 71 times, Birmingham, Liverpool and Plymouth eight times, Bristol six, Glasgow five, Southampton four, Portsmouth and Hull three, and there was also at least one large raid on another eight cities. This was a result of a rapid escalation starting on 24 August 1940, when night bombers aiming for RAF airfields drifted off course and accidentally destroyed several London homes, killing civilians, combined with the UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill's immediate response of bombing Berlin on the following night.\nStarting on 7 September 1940, London was bombed by the Luftwaffe for 57 consecutive nights. More than one million London houses were destroyed or damaged, and more than 40,000 civilians were killed, almost half of them in London. Ports and industrial centres outside London were also heavily attacked. The major Atlantic sea port of Liverpool was also heavily bombed, causing nearly 4,000 deaths within the Merseyside area during the war. The North Sea port of Hull, a convenient and easily found primary and secondary target for bombers unable to locate their primary targets, was subjected to 86 raids, within the city boundaries during the war, with a conservative estimate of 1200 civilians killed and 95% of its housing stock destroyed or damaged. Other ports including Bristol, Cardiff, Portsmouth, Plymouth, Southampton, and Swansea were also targeted, as were the industrial cities of Birmingham, Belfast, Coventry, Glasgow and Manchester. Birmingham and Coventry were heavily targeted because of the Spitfire and tank factories in Birmingham and the many munitions factories in Coventry; the city centre of Coventry was almost completely destroyed.\nThe bombing did not achieve its intended goals of demoralising the British into surrender or significantly damaging their war economy. The eight months of bombing never seriously hampered British production, and the war industries continued to operate and expand. The Blitz did not facilitate Operation Sea Lion, the planned German invasion of Britain. By May 1941 the threat of an invasion of Britain had passed, and Hitler's attention had turned to Operation Barbarossa in the East. In comparison to the Allied bombing campaign against Germany, the Blitz resulted in relatively few casualties; the British bombing of Hamburg in July 1943 alone inflicted about 42,000 civilian casualties, about the same as the entire Blitz.\nSeveral reasons have been suggested for the failure of the German air offensive. The Luftwaffe High Command (Oberkommando der Luftwaffe, or OKL) failed to develop a coherent long-term strategy for destroying Britain's war industries, frequently switching from bombing one type of industry to another without exerting any sustained pressure on any one of them. Neither was the Luftwaffe equipped to carry out a long-term strategic air campaign, lacking among other things a heavy four-engined bomber, and its intelligence on British industry and capabilities was poor. All of these shortcomings denied the Luftwaffe the ability to make a strategic difference.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blitz	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b2/Stpaulsblitz.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/The_Home_Front_in_Britain_during_the_Second_World_War_HU44272.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/The_Second_World_War_1939_-_1945-_the_Home_Front_HU1129.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/WWII_London_Blitz_East_London.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Flag_of_German_Reich_%281935%E2%80%931945%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Coventry_bomb_damage_H5600.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Hyde_Park_Anti-aircraft_guns_H_993.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Heinkel_over_Wapping.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/LondonBombedWWII_full.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Liverpool_Blitz_D_5984.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Map_of_Knickebein_transmitters.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/London_Blitz_791940.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/St_Paul_after_the_Blitz.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Pilots_of_No._310_%28Czechoslovak%29_Squadron_RAF_in_front_of_Hawker_Hurricane_Mk_I_at_Duxford%2C_Cambridgeshire%2C_7_September_1940._CH1299.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Blitzaftermath.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/Birmingham_Blitz_D_4126.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Boulton_Paul_Defiant_RAF_Museum.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Bomb_Damage_in_London_during_the_Second_World_War_HU36157.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/A_young_woman_plays_a_gramophone_in_an_air_raid_shelter_in_north_London_during_1940._D1631.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Big_Ben_Clear_Skies.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/Air_Raid_Damage_in_London%2C_1940_HU36206.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-2004-1202-504%2C_Berlin%2C_Adolf_Hitler_und_Hermann_G%C3%B6ring.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Bundesarchiv_Bild_141-1941%2C_Walther_Wever.jpg"]	f	cover
438	United Nations	The United Nations (UN) is an intergovernmental organization established on 24 October 1945 to promote international co-operation. A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was created following the Second World War to prevent another such conflict. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193. The UN Headquarters is situated in Manhattan, New York City and enjoys extraterritoriality. Further main offices are situated in Geneva, Nairobi and Vienna. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict.\nDuring the Second World War, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt initiated talks on a successor agency to the League of Nations, and the United Nations Charter was drafted at a conference in April–June 1945; this charter took effect on 24 October 1945, and the UN began operation. The UN's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the US and Soviet Union and their respective allies. The organization participated in major actions in Korea and the Congo, as well as approving the creation of the state of Israel in 1947. The organization's membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization in the 1960s, and by the 1970s its budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping. After the end of the Cold War, the UN took on major military and peacekeeping missions across the world with varying degrees of success.\nThe UN has six principal organs: the General Assembly (the main deliberative assembly); the Security Council (for deciding certain resolutions for peace and security); the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) (for promoting international economic and social co-operation and development); the Secretariat (for providing studies, information, and facilities needed by the UN); the International Court of Justice (the primary judicial organ); and the United Nations Trusteeship Council (inactive since 1994). UN System agencies include the World Bank Group, the World Health Organization, the World Food Programme, UNESCO, and UNICEF. The UN's most prominent officer is the Secretary-General, an office held by South Korean Ban Ki-moon since 2007. Non-governmental organizations may be granted consultative status with ECOSOC and other agencies to participate in the UN's work.\nThe organization won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2001, and a number of its officers and agencies have also been awarded the prize. Other evaluations of the UN's effectiveness have been mixed. Some commentators believe the organization to be an important force for peace and human development, while others have called the organization ineffective, corrupt, or biased.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/88/Chile_signs_UN_Charter_1945.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg",

434	Cold War	The Cold War was a sustained state of political and military tension between powers in the Western Bloc (the United States with NATO and others) and powers in the Eastern Bloc (the Soviet Union and its allies in Warsaw Pact). Historians have not fully agreed on the dates, but 1947–1991 is common. It was "cold" because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two sides, although there were major regional wars in Korea and Vietnam. The Cold War split the temporary wartime alliance against Nazi Germany, leaving the USSR and the US as two superpowers with profound economic and political differences over capitalism and democracy. A deliberately neutral grouping arose with the Non-Aligned Movement founded by Egypt, India, and Yugoslavia; this faction rejected association with either the US-led West or the Soviet-led East.\nThe two superpowers never engaged directly in full-scale armed combat but they each armed heavily in preparation of an all-out nuclear World War III. Each side had a nuclear deterrent that deterred an attack by the other side, on the basis that such an attack would lead to total destruction of the attacker: the doctrine of mutually assured destruction or MAD. Aside from the development of the two sides' nuclear arsenals, and deployment of conventional military forces, the struggle for dominance was expressed via proxy wars around the globe, psychological warfare, propaganda and espionage, and technological competitions such as the Space Race.\nThe first phase of the Cold War began in the aftermath of the end of the Second World War. The USSR consolidated its control over the states of the Eastern Bloc while the United States began a strategy of global containment to challenge Soviet power, extending military and financial aid to the countries of Western Europe (for example, supporting the anti-Communist side in the Greek Civil War) and creating the NATO alliance. The Berlin Blockade (1948–49) was the first major crisis of the Cold War.\nWith victory of the Communist side in the Chinese Civil War and the outbreak of the Korean War (1950–53), the conflict expanded as the USSR and USA competed for influence in Latin America and decolonizing states of Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Meanwhile the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 was brutally crushed by the Soviets. The expansion and escalation sparked more crises, such as the Suez Crisis (1956), the Berlin Crisis of 1961, the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. Following this last crisis a new phase began that saw the Sino-Soviet split complicate relations within the Communist sphere while US allies, particularly France, demonstrated greater independence of action. The USSR crushed the 1968 Prague Spring liberalization program in Czechoslovakia and the Vietnam War (1955–1975) ended with a defeat of the US-backed Republic of South Vietnam, prompting further adjustments.\nBy the 1970s both sides had become interested in accommodations to create a more stable and predictable international system, inaugurating a period of détente that saw Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and the US opening relations with the People's Republic of China as a strategic counterweight to the Soviet Union. Détente collapsed at the end of the decade with the Soviet war in Afghanistan beginning in 1979.\nThe early 1980s were another period of elevated tension, with the Soviet downing of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 (1983), and the "Able Archer" NATO military exercises (1983). The United States increased diplomatic, military, and economic pressures on the Soviet Union, at a time when the communist state was already suffering from economic stagnation. In the mid-1980s, the new Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev introduced the liberalizing reforms of perestroika ("reorganization", 1987) and glasnost ("openness", ca. 1985) and ended Soviet involvement in Afghanistan. Pressures for national independence grew stronger in Eastern Europe, especially Poland. Gorbachev meanwhile refused to use Soviet troops to bolster the faltering Warsaw Pact regimes as had occurred in the past. The result in 1989 was a wave of revolutions that peacefully (with the exception of the Romanian Revolution) overthrew all of the Communist regimes of Central and Eastern Europe. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union itself lost control and was banned following an abortive coup attempt in August 1991. This in turn led to the formal dissolution of the USSR in December 1991 and the collapse of Communist regimes in other countries such as Mongolia, Cambodia and South Yemen. The United States remained as the world's only superpower.\nThe Cold War and its events have left a significant legacy, and it is often referred to in popular culture, especially in media featuring themes of espionage (such as the internationally successful James Bond film series) and the threat of nuclear warfare.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/SDIO_Delta_Star.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/USSR-1961-stamps-%D0%A1%D0%9D%D0%90.jpg",

129	Cantata	A cantata (literally "sung", derived from the Italian word "cantare") is a vocal composition with an instrumental accompaniment, typically in several movements, often involving a choir.\nThe meaning of the term changed over time, from the simple single voice madrigal of the early 17th century, to the multi-voice "cantata da camera" and the "cantata da chiesa" of the later part of that century, from the more substantial dramatic forms of the 18th century (including the 200-odd sacred and secular cantatas of Johann Sebastian Bach) to the usually sacred-texted 19th-century cantata, which was effectively a type of short oratorio. Several cantatas were written for special occasions, such as Christmas cantatas.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/90/EinFesteBurg.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantata	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Bach%2C_BWV_147%2C_10._Jesus_bleibet_meine_Freude.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/90/EinFesteBurg.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Wo_ist_doch.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg"]	f	cover
187	Deism	Deism (/ˈdiː.ɪzəm/ or /ˈdeɪ.ɪzəm/) is the belief that reason and observation of the natural world are sufficient to determine the existence of a Creator, accompanied with the rejection of revelation and authority as a source of religious knowledge. Deism gained prominence in the 17th and 18th centuries during the Age of Enlightenment—especially in Britain, France, Germany, and the United States—among intellectuals raised as Christians who believed in one god, but found fault with organized religion and did not believe in supernatural events such as miracles, the inerrancy of scriptures, or the Trinity.\nDeism is derived from deus, the Latin word for god. Deistic ideas influenced several leaders of the American and French Revolutions. Two main forms of deism currently exist: classical deism and modern deism.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/LifeAndWorksOfConfucius1687.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/LifeAndWorksOfConfucius1687.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Speakerlink-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/P_religion_world.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Thomas_Paine.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/D%27apr%C3%A8s_Nicolas_de_Largilli%C3%A8re%2C_portrait_de_Voltaire_%28Institut_et_Mus%C3%A9e_Voltaire%29_-001.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Edward_Herbert_1st_Baron_Herbert_of_Cherbury_by_Isaac_Oliver.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/David_Hume.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg"]	f	cover
417	George Gershwin	George Gershwin (September 26, 1898 –  July 11, 1937) was an American composer and pianist. Gershwin's compositions spanned both popular and classical genres, and his most popular melodies are widely known. Among his best known works are the orchestral compositions Rhapsody in Blue (1924) and An American in Paris (1928), as well as the opera Porgy and Bess (1935).\nGershwin studied piano under Charles Hambitzer and composition with Rubin Goldmark and Henry Cowell. He began his career as a song plugger, but soon started composing Broadway theatre works with his brother Ira Gershwin and Buddy DeSylva. He moved to Paris to study with Nadia Boulanger, where he began to compose An American in Paris. After returning to New York City, he wrote Porgy and Bess with Ira and the author DuBose Heyward. Initially a commercial failure, Porgy and Bess is now considered one of the most important American operas of the twentieth century. Gershwin moved to Hollywood and composed numerous film scores until his death in 1937 from a brain tumor.\nGershwin's compositions have been adapted for use in many films and for television, and several became jazz standards recorded in many variations. Countless celebrated singers and musicians have covered his songs.	\N	\N	\N	http://www.classical.net/music/images/composer/g/gershwn1.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gershwin	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Al_Jolson%2C_George_Gershwin%2C_Irving_Caesar%2C_Swanee_1920.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Ravel_Gershwin_Leide-Tedesco002.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/George_Gershwin-signed.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Gershwin_best_800.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/George_Gershwin_1937.jpg"]	f	90%
273	William Wordsworth	William Wordsworth (7 April 1770 – 23 April 1850) was a major English Romantic poet who, with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, helped to launch the Romantic Age in English literature with the 1798 joint publication Lyrical Ballads.\nWordsworth's magnum opus is generally considered to be The Prelude, a semiautobiographical poem of his early years which he revised and expanded a number of times. It was posthumously titled and published, prior to which it was generally known as "the poem to Coleridge". Wordsworth was Britain's Poet Laureate from 1843 until his death in 1850.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wordsworth	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/William_Wordsworth_at_28_by_William_Shuter2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Benjamin_Robert_Haydon_002.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Quill_and_ink.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Padlock-silver-light.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/William_Wordsworth_001.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/WilliamWordsworth_Grave.JPG"]	f	cover
131	Fugue	In music, a fugue (/fjuːɡ/ FEWG) is a contrapuntal compositional technique in two or more voices, built on a subject (theme) that is introduced at the beginning in imitation (repetition at different pitches) and recurs frequently in the course of the composition.\nThe English term fugue originated in the 16th century and is derived from the French word fugue or the Italian fuga. This in turn comes from Latin, also fuga, which is itself related to both fugere ("to flee") and fugare ("to chase"). The adjectival form is fugal. Variants include fughetta (literally, "a small fugue") and fugato (a passage in fugal style within another work that is not a fugue).\nA fugue usually has three sections: an exposition, a development, and a recapitulation containing the return of the subject in the fugue's tonic key, though not all fugues have a recapitulation. In the Middle Ages, the term was widely used to denote any works in canonic style; by the Renaissance, it had come to denote specifically imitative works. Since the 17th century, the term fugue has described what is commonly regarded as the most fully developed procedure of imitative counterpoint.\nMost fugues open with a short main theme, the subject, which then sounds successively in each voice (after the first voice is finished stating the subject, a second voice repeats the subject at a different pitch, and other voices repeat in the same way); when each voice has entered, the exposition is complete. This is often followed by a connecting passage, or episode, developed from previously heard material; further "entries" of the subject then are heard in related keys. Episodes (if applicable) and entries are usually alternated until the "final entry" of the subject, by which point the music has returned to the opening key, or tonic, which is often followed by closing material, the coda. In this sense, a fugue is a style of composition, rather than a fixed structure.\nThe form evolved during the 18th century from several earlier types of contrapuntal compositions, such as imitative ricercars, capriccios, canzonas, and fantasias. The famous fugue composer Johann Sebastian Bach (1685–1750) shaped his own works after those of Johann Jakob Froberger (1616–1667), Johann Pachelbel (1653–1706), Girolamo Frescobaldi (1583–1643), Dieterich Buxtehude (c. 1637–1707) and others. With the decline of sophisticated styles at the end of the baroque period, the fugue's central role waned, eventually giving way as sonata form and the symphony orchestra rose to a dominant position. Nevertheless, composers continued to write and study fugues for various purposes; they appear in the works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756–1791) and Ludwig van Beethoven (1770–1827), as well as modern composers like Dmitri Shostakovich (1906–1975).	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/03/Interval_Inversion.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/56/False_entry.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Kdf2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Wiki_fugue_analysis_audio.mid", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Respuesta_tonal_en_la_fuga.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Comienzo_Fuga_en_Sol_menor.mid", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/59/Wiki-fugue-analysis.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Fugue_in_C_major_by_Johann_Caspar_Ferdinand_Fischer.mid", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Fischer-fugue1.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg"]	f	cover
132	Sonata	Sonata (/səˈnɑːtə/; Italian: [soˈnaːta], pl. sonate; from Latin and Italian: sonare, "to sound"), in music, literally means a piece played as opposed to a cantata (Latin and Italian cantare, "to sing"), a piece sung. The term, being vague, evolved through the history of music, designating a variety of forms until the Classical era, when it took on increasing importance, and by the early 19th century came to represent a principle of composing large scale works. It was applied to most instrumental genres and regarded—alongside the fugue—as one of two fundamental methods of organizing, interpreting and analyzing concert music. Though the musical style of sonatas has changed since the Classical era, most 20th- and 21st-century sonatas still maintain the same structure.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonata	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Beethoven_-_Piano_Sonata_No._28_in_A_Major%2C_Op._101_-_III._Langsam_und_sehnsuchtsvoll_and_IV._Geschwind%2C_doch_nicht_zu_sehr_und_mit_Entschlossenheit.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Beethoven_opus_101_manuscript.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Beethoven_-_Piano_Sonata_No._28_in_A_Major%2C_Op._101_-_I._Etwas_lebhaft%2C_und_mit_der_innigsten_Empfindung.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Beethoven_-_Piano_Sonata_No._28_in_A_Major%2C_Op._101_-_II._Lebhaft._Marschm%C3%A4%C3%9Fig.ogg"]	f	cover
135	Antonio Stradivari	Antonio Stradivari (Italian pronunciation: [anˈtɔːnjo stradiˈvaːri]; 1644 – 18 December 1737) was an Italian luthier and a crafter of string instruments such as violins, cellos, guitars, violas, and harps. Stradivari is generally considered the most significant and greatest artisan in this field. The Latinized form of his surname, Stradivarius, as well as the colloquial, "Strad", is often used to refer to his instruments. It is estimated that he made 1,000 to 1,100 instruments and that around 650 of these instruments survive, including 450 to 512 violins.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Stradivari	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Stradshp.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Stradivari_house.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Antonio_stradivari.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Cremona_centro.jpg"]	f	cover

During the late 18th century it gradually disappeared from the musical scene with the rise of the fortepiano. But in the 20th century it made a resurgence, used in historically informed performance of older music, in new (contemporary) compositions, and in popular culture.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpsichord	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Resonance_Chladni_Soundboard_Harpsichord_Clavecin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Shove_Coupler.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4d/DolmetschSpinet_LateWinter.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/FalseInnerOuterHarpsichord.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Domenico_Scarlatti_-_Allegretto_-_D_minor.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/HarpsichordMechanism-EN.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Jack_diagram-EN.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Harpsichord_jack_action.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Johannes_Vermeer_-_Lady_Standing_at_a_Virginal.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Johann_Sebastian_Bach_-_The_English_Suite_-1_-_12EPrelude.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Peter_Watchorn_pedal_harpsichord.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/MDMB_418%2C_detall_de_clavic%C3%A8mbal%2C_Christian_Zell%2C_Museu_de_la_M%C3%BAsica_de_Barcelona.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Bachbwv933.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/Bach_C_Major_Prelude_Equal.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/ClavecinRuckers%26Taskin.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Britannica_Serpent.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/035_Museu_de_la_M%C3%BAsica.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/ArnaultDeZwolle.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Adriano_Banchieri_-_The_Battle.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Dogleg_shove_coupler.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Clavier_Dodeka_7_SmallRVB.jpg"]	f	cover
139	Pythagoras	Pythagoras of Samos (/pɪˈθæɡərəs/; Ancient Greek: Πυθαγόρας ὁ Σάμιος Pythagóras ho Sámios “Pythagoras the Samian”, or simply Πυθαγόρας; Πυθαγόρης in Ionian Greek; c. 570 BC – c. 495 BC) was an Ionian Greek philosopher, mathematician, and founder of the religious movement called Pythagoreanism. Most of the information about Pythagoras was written down centuries after he lived, so very little reliable information is known about him. He was born on the island of Samos, and might have travelled widely in his youth, visiting Egypt and other places seeking knowledge. Around 530 BC, he moved to Croton, in Magna Graecia, and there set up a religious sect. His followers pursued the religious rites and practices developed by Pythagoras and studied his philosophical theories. The society took an active role in the politics of Croton but this eventually led to their downfall. Pythagorean meeting-places were burned and Pythagoras was forced to flee the city. He is said to have died in Metapontum.\nPythagoras made influential contributions to philosophy and religion in the late 6th century BC. He is often revered as a great mathematician, mystic, and scientist and is best known for the Pythagorean theorem which bears his name. However, because legend and obfuscation cloud his work even more than that of the other pre-Socratic philosophers, one can give only a tentative account of his teachings, and some have questioned whether he contributed much to mathematics or natural philosophy. Many of the accomplishments credited to Pythagoras may actually have been accomplishments of his colleagues and successors. Whether or not his disciples believed that everything was related to mathematics and that numbers were the ultimate reality is unknown. It was said that he was the first man to call himself a philosopher, or lover of wisdom, and Pythagorean ideas exercised a marked influence on Plato, and through him, all of Western philosophy.\n\n	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/62/PD-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Sanzio_01_Pythagoras.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Nuremberg_chronicles_f_61v_2.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Pythagoras-M%C3%BCnz.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/People_icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Crotone_panorama_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Kapitolinischer_Pythagoras_adjusted.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Gaffurio_Pythagoras.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Pythag_anim.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Pythagorean.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Pythagoras_Bust_Vatican_Museum.jpg"]	f	cover
141	Claudio Monteverdi	Claudio Giovanni Antonio Monteverdi (Italian: [ˈklaudjo monteˈverdi]; 15 May 1567 (baptized) – 29 November 1643) was an Italian composer, gambist, singer and Roman Catholic priest.\nMonteverdi's work, often regarded as revolutionary, marked the transition from the Renaissance style of music to that of the Baroque period. He developed two individual styles of composition – the heritage of Renaissance polyphony and the new basso continuo technique of the Baroque. Monteverdi wrote one of the earliest operas, L'Orfeo, an innovative work that is the earliest surviving opera that is still regularly performed. He was recognized as an innovative composer and enjoyed considerable fame in his lifetime.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudio_Monteverdi	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Primeiro_retrato_de_Monteverdi.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Monteverdi_-_non_si_levav%27ancor.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Frontispiece_of_L%27Orfeo.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Monteverdi-cor_mio_mentre_vi_miro.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Laudate_pueri.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Bernardo_Strozzi_-_Claudio_Monteverdi_%28c.1630%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Deus_in_adiutorium.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Claudio_Monteverdi_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Monteverdi_-_cruda_amarilli.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Monteverdi_-_Lamento_della_Ninfa.ogg"]	f	cover
350	Quantum theory	Electromagnetic radiation (EM radiation or EMR) is a form of radiant energy, propagating through space via electromagnetic waves and/or particles called photons. In a vacuum, it propagates at a characteristic speed, the speed of light, normally in straight lines. EMR is emitted and absorbed by charged particles. As an electromagnetic wave, it has both electric and magnetic field components, which oscillate in a fixed relationship to one another, perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to the direction of energy and wave propagation.\nElectromagnetic waves in free space must be solutions of Maxwell's electromagnetic wave equation. Two main classes of solutions are known, namely plane waves and spherical waves. The plane waves may be viewed as the limiting case of spherical waves at a very large (ideally infinite) distance from the source. Both types of waves can have a waveform which is an arbitrary time function (so long as it is sufficiently differentiable to conform to the wave equation). As with any time function, this can be decomposed by means of Fourier analysis into its frequency spectrum, or individual sinusoidal components, each of which contains a single frequency, amplitude, and phase. Such a component wave is said to be monochromatic. A monochromatic electromagnetic wave can be characterized by its frequency or wavelength, its peak amplitude, its phase relative to some reference phase, its direction of propagation, and its polarization.\nFor certain classes of EM waves, the waveform is most usefully treated as random, and then spectral analysis must be done by slightly different mathematical techniques appropriate to random or stochastic processes. In such cases, the individual frequency components are represented in terms of their power content, and the phase information is not preserved. Such a representation is called the power spectral density of the random process. Random electromagnetic radiation requiring this kind of analysis is, for example, encountered in the interior of stars, and in certain other very wideband forms of radiation such as the Zero-Point wave field of the electromagnetic vacuum.\nThe electromagnetic spectrum, in order of increasing frequency and decreasing wavelength, can be divided, for practical engineering purposes, into radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays and gamma rays. The eyes of various organisms sense a relatively small range of frequencies of EMR called the visible spectrum or light; what is visible depends somewhat on which species of organism is under consideration. Higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths) correspond to proportionately more energy carried by each photon, according to the well-known law E=hν, where E is the energy per photon, ν is the frequency carried by the photon, and h is Planck's constant. For instance, a single gamma ray photon carries far more energy than a single photon of visible light.\nElectromagnetic radiation is associated with EM fields that are free to propagate themselves without the continuing influence of the moving charges that produced them, because they have achieved sufficient distance from those charges. Thus, EMR is sometimes referred to as the far field. In this language, the near field refers to EM fields near the charges and current that directly produced them, as for example with simple magnets and static electricity phenomena. In EMR, the magnetic and electric fields are each induced by changes in the other type of field, thus propagating itself as a wave. This close relationship assures that both types of fields in EMR stand in phase and in a fixed ratio of intensity to each other, with maxima and nodes in each found at the same places in space.\nEMR carries energy—sometimes called radiant energy—through space continuously away from the source (this is not true of the near-field part of the EM field). EMR also carries both momentum and angular momentum. These properties may all be imparted to matter with which it interacts. EMR is produced from other types of energy when created, and it is converted to other types of energy when it is destroyed. The photon is the quantum of the electromagnetic interaction, and is the basic "unit" or constituent of all forms of EMR. The quantum nature of light becomes more apparent at high frequencies (thus high photon energy). Such photons behave more like particles than lower-frequency photons do.\nIn classical physics, EMR is considered to be produced when charged particles are accelerated by forces acting on them. Electrons are responsible for emission of most EMR because they have low mass, and therefore are easily accelerated by a variety of mechanisms. Rapidly moving electrons are most sharply accelerated when they encounter a region of force, so they are responsible for producing much of the highest frequency electromagnetic radiation observed in nature. Quantum processes can also produce EMR, such as when atomic nuclei undergo gamma decay, and processes such as neutral pion decay.\nThe effects of EMR upon biological systems (and also to many other chemical systems, under standard conditions) depend both upon the radiation's power and frequency. For lower frequencies of EMR up to those of visible light (i.e., radio, microwave, infrared), the damage done to cells and also to many ordinary materials under such conditions is determined mainly by heating effects, and thus by the radiation power. By contrast, for higher frequency radiations at ultraviolet frequencies and above (i.e., X-rays and gamma rays) the damage to chemical materials and living cells by EMR is far larger than that done by simple heating, due to the ability of single photons in such high frequency EMR to damage individual molecules chemically.	\N	\N	\N	http://www.classdrc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/quantum-image1-300x240.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_theory	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/FarNearFields-USP-4998112-1.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Electromagneticwave3Dfromside.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Onde_electromagnetique.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Light_spectrum.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Atmospheric_electromagnetic_opacity.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Electromagneticwave3D.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/EM_spectrum.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/VisibleEmrWavelengths.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/VFPt_Solenoid_correct2.svg"]	f	
189	Jean-Jacques Rousseau	Jean-Jacques Rousseau (French: [ʒɑ̃ʒak ʁuso]; 28 June 1712 – 2 July 1778) was a Genevan philosopher, writer, and composer of the 18th century. His political philosophy influenced the French Revolution as well as the overall development of modern political, sociological, and educational thought.\nRousseau's novel Émile, or On Education is a treatise on the education of the whole person for citizenship. His sentimental novel Julie, or the New Heloise was of importance to the development of pre-romanticism and romanticism in fiction. Rousseau's autobiographical writings—his Confessions, which initiated the modern autobiography, and his Reveries of a Solitary Walker—exemplified the late 18th-century movement known as the Age of Sensibility, and featured an increased focus on subjectivity and introspection that later characterized modern writing. His Discourse on the Origin of Inequality and his On the Social Contract are cornerstones in modern political and social thought. He argued that private property was conventional and the beginning of true civil society.\nRousseau was a successful composer of music, who wrote seven operas as well as music in other forms, and made contributions to music as a theorist. During the period of the French Revolution, Rousseau was the most popular of the philosophes among members of the Jacobin Club. Rousseau was interred as a national hero in the Panthéon in Paris, in 1794, 16 years after his death.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Rousseau_in_later_life.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Rousseauplaque.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Rousseauvenicembassy.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau_Romania1962.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau_%28painted_portrait%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/LesCharmettes.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Padlock-silver-light.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Open_book_nae_French_flag.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Prinsenvlag.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Pierre_Alexandre_du_Peyrou.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Rousseau_Geneve_House.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Rousseau_Geneve.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Flag_of_Switzerland.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Flag_of_Spain_%281785-1873_and_1875-1931%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Flickr_-_Jeff_Attaway_-_fish_pole.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Allan_Ramsay_-_Jean-Jacques_Rousseau_%281712_-_1778%29_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Flag_of_Prussia_1892-1918.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/DOI_Rousseau.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Jean-Jacques_ROUSSEAU_au_Panth%C3%A9on_%28Lunon%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Ile_Rousseau_Geneva_Switzerland.JPG"]	f	cover
145	Felix Mendelssohn	Jakob Ludwig Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy (German: [ˈjaːkɔp ˈluːtvɪç ˈfeːlɪks ˈmɛndl̩szoːn baʁˈtɔldi]; 3 February 1809 –  4 November 1847), born and widely known as Felix Mendelssohn, was a German composer, pianist, organist and conductor of the early Romantic period.\nA grandson of the philosopher Moses Mendelssohn, Felix Mendelssohn was born into a prominent Jewish family, although initially he was raised without religion and was later baptised as a Reformed Christian. Mendelssohn was recognised early as a musical prodigy, but his parents were cautious and did not seek to capitalise on his talent.\nEarly success in Germany, where he also revived interest in the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, was followed by travel throughout Europe. Mendelssohn was particularly well received in Britain as a composer, conductor and soloist, and his ten visits there – during which many of his major works were premiered – form an important part of his adult career. His essentially conservative musical tastes, however, set him apart from many of his more adventurous musical contemporaries such as Franz Liszt, Richard Wagner and Hector Berlioz. The Leipzig Conservatoire (now the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig), which he founded, became a bastion of this anti-radical outlook.\nMendelssohn wrote symphonies, concerti, oratorios, piano music and chamber music. His best-known works include his Overture and incidental music for A Midsummer Night's Dream, the Italian Symphony, the Scottish Symphony, the overture The Hebrides, his mature Violin Concerto, and his String Octet. His Songs Without Words are his most famous solo piano compositions. After a long period of relative denigration due to changing musical tastes and anti-Semitism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, his creative originality has now been recognised and re-evaluated. He is now among the most popular composers of the Romantic era.\n\n	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Mendelssohn	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Mendelssohn_Statue_Thomaskirche.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/90/EinFesteBurg.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Mendelssohn_Bartholdy_1821.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Mendelssohn_Wedding_March_Theme.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Felix_Mendelssohn_Leipzig_study%3B_Contemporary_view.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Elijah_arranged_for_duet_1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/JennyLind-photo.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Felixmendelssohngrave.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Ansicht_von_Luzern_-_Aquarell_Mendelsohn_1847.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Mendelssohn_VnConcert_op64_2mvt.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/DPAG_2009_Felix_Mendelssohn_Bartholdy.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Cecile_Mendelssohn_Bartholdy.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Octetp1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Mendelssohn_Bartholdy.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Mendelssohn-Denkmal-Leipzig_Kohut-1-S41-cropped.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Mendelssohn_oregan_sonatas.jpg"]	f	cover
373	Edvard Munch	Edvard Munch (12 December 1863 - 23 January 1944) was a Norwegian painter and printmaker whose intensely evocative treatment of psychological themes built upon some of the main tenets of late 19th-century Symbolism and greatly influenced German Expressionism in the early 20th century.

146	Miguel de Cervantes	Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra (Spanish: [miˈɣel de θerˈβantes saaˈβeðɾa]; 29 September 1547 (assumed) – 22 April 1616) was a Spanish novelist, poet, and playwright.\nHis magnum opus, Don Quixote, considered to be the first modern European novel, is a classic of Western literature, and is regarded amongst the best works of fiction ever written. His influence on the Spanish language has been so great that the language is often called la lengua de Cervantes ("the language of Cervantes"). He was dubbed El Príncipe de los Ingenios ("The Prince of Wits").\nIn 1569, Cervantes moved to Rome where he worked as chamber assistant of a wealthy priest. Cervantes then enlisted as a soldier in a Spanish Navy infantry regiment and continued his military life until 1575, when he was captured by Algerian corsairs. After 5 years of slavery he was released on ransom from his captors by his parents and the Trinitarians, a Catholic religious order. He subsequently returned to his family in Madrid.\nIn 1585, Cervantes published a pastoral novel named La Galatea. Because of financial problems, he worked as a purveyor for the Spanish Armada, and later as a tax collector. In 1597, discrepancies in his accounts of three years previous landed him in the Crown Jail of Seville. In 1605, he was in Valladolid when the immediate success of the first part of his Don Quixote, published in Madrid, signaled his return to the literary world. In 1607, he settled in Madrid, where he lived and worked until his death. During the last 9 years of his life, Cervantes solidified his reputation as a writer; he published the Novelas ejemplares (Exemplary Novels) in 1613, the Journey to Parnassus (Viaje al Parnaso) in 1614, and in 1615, the Ocho comedias y ocho entremeses and the 2nd part of Don Quixote. Carlos Fuentes noted that, "Cervantes leaves the page open where the reader knows himself read and the author written."	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_de_Cervantes	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/The_Battle_of_Lepanto_by_Paolo_Veronese.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Gustave_Dor%C3%A9_-_Miguel_de_Cervantes_-_Don_Quixote_-_Part_1_-_Chapter_1_-_Plate_1_%22A_world_of_disorderly_notions%2C_picked_out_of_his_books%2C_crowded_into_his_imagination%22.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Miguel_cervantes_de_saavedra.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Los_trabajos_de_Persiles_y_Sigismunda_%281617%29.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Miguel_de_Cervantes_at_the_National_Library.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Miguel_de_Cervantes_Saavedra_01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Cervates_jauregui.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Viaje_del_Parnaso.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/La_Galatea_First_Edition_Title_Page.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Don_Quixote.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Nafpaktos_evlahos.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Miguel_de_Cervantes_signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg"]	f	cover
192	Denis Diderot	Denis Diderot (French: [dəni didʁo]) (5 October 1713 – 31 July 1784) was a French philosopher, art critic and writer. He was a prominent person during the Enlightenment, and is best known for serving as co-founder, chief editor and contributor to the Encyclopédie along with Jean le Rond d'Alembert.\nDiderot also contributed to literature, notably with Jacques le fataliste et son maître (Jacques the Fatalist and his Master), which emulated Laurence Sterne in challenging conventions regarding novels and their structure and content,[citation needed] while also examining philosophical ideas about free will. Diderot is also known as the author of the dialogue Le Neveu de Rameau (Rameau's Nephew), upon which many articles and sermons about consumer desire have been based.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Diderot	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/62/PD-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/N%C2%B0_9_de_la_place_dans_le_centre_ville_de_Langres.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Langres_-_Denis_Diderot.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Paul_Heinrich_Dietrich_Baron_d%27Holbach.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Open_book_nae_French_flag.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Prinsenvlag.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Un_d%C3%AEner_de_philosophes.Jean_Huber.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Diderot-statue.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Diderot%27s_travel_from_Paris_to_Saint_Petersburg_in_1773-1774_map-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Flag_of_Prussia_1892-1918.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Encyclopedie_de_D%27Alembert_et_Diderot_-_Premiere_Page_-_ENC_1-NA5.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Book_collection.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Denis_Diderot_signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Denis_Diderot_111.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Flag_of_Spain_%281785-1873_and_1875-1931%29.svg"]	f	cover
147	John Milton	John Milton (9 December 1608 – 8 November 1674) was an English poet, polemicist, man of letters, and a civil servant for the Commonwealth of England under Oliver Cromwell. He wrote at a time of religious flux and political upheaval, and is best known for his epic poem Paradise Lost (1667), written in blank verse.\nMilton's poetry and prose reflect deep personal convictions, a passion for freedom and self-determination, and the urgent issues and political turbulence of his day. Writing in English, Latin, Greek, and Italian, he achieved international renown within his lifetime, and his celebrated Areopagitica (1644)—written in condemnation of pre-publication censorship—is among history's most influential and impassioned defenses of free speech and freedom of the press.\nWilliam Hayley's 1796 biography called him the "greatest English author," and he remains generally regarded "as one of the preeminent writers in the English language," though critical reception has oscillated in the centuries since his death (often on account of his republicanism). Samuel Johnson praised Paradise Lost as "a poem which...with respect to design may claim the first place, and with respect to performance, the second, among the productions of the human mind," though he (a Tory and recipient of royal patronage) described Milton's politics as those of an "acrimonious and surly republican".\nBecause of his republicanism, Milton has been the subject of centuries of British partisanship.[when?][citation needed]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milton	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ed/Areopagitica_bridwell.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Temple_of_British_Worthies_John_Milton.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/John_Milton_plaque_Berkyn_Manor_Farm_Horton.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/John_Milton_1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/John_Milton_signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/John_Milton_plaque_Bread_Street_London.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Areopagitica_1644bw_gobeirne.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/John-milton.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Eug%C3%A8ne_Ferdinand_Victor_Delacroix_032.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Milton_a_Poem_copy_D_1818_Library_of_Congress_object_1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/MiltonPoeticalWorksNewton1752-61.jpg"]	f	cover
149	Daniel Defoe	Daniel Defoe (/ˌdænjəl dɨˈfoʊ/; c. 1660 – 24 April 1731), born Daniel Foe, was an English trader, writer, journalist, pamphleteer, and spy, now most famous for his novel Robinson Crusoe. Defoe is notable for being one of the earliest proponents of the novel, as he helped to popularise the form in Britain, and, along with others such as Samuel Richardson, is among the founders of the English novel. A prolific and versatile writer, he wrote more than 500 books, pamphlets and journals on various topics (including politics, crime, religion, marriage, psychology and the supernatural).

153	Science	Science (from Latin scientia, meaning "knowledge") is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. In an older and closely related meaning, "science" also refers to a body of knowledge itself, of the type that can be rationally explained and reliably applied. A practitioner of science is known as a scientist.\nSince classical antiquity, science as a type of knowledge has been closely linked to philosophy. In the early modern period the words "science" and "philosophy of nature" were sometimes used interchangeably. By the 17th century, natural philosophy (which is today called "natural science") was considered a separate branch of philosophy.\nIn modern usage, "science" most often refers to a way of pursuing knowledge, not only the knowledge itself. It is also often restricted to those branches of study that seek to explain the phenomena of the material universe. In the 17th and 18th centuries scientists increasingly sought to formulate knowledge in terms of laws of nature such as Newton's laws of motion. And over the course of the 19th century, the word "science" became increasingly associated with the scientific method itself, as a disciplined way to study the natural world, including physics, chemistry, geology and biology. It is in the 19th century also that the term scientist was created by the naturalist-theologian William Whewell to distinguish those who sought knowledge on nature from those who sought other types of knowledge.\nHowever, "science" has also continued to be used in a broad sense to denote reliable and teachable knowledge about a topic, as reflected in modern terms like library science or computer science. This is also reflected in the names of some areas of academic study such as "social science" or "political science".\n\n	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fc/Rubin_vera_f1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Nuvola_apps_kalzium.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/The_Scientific_Universe.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Riccio_Melone_a_Capo_Caccia_adventurediving.it.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Tycho_instrument_sextant_mounting_19.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/dd/Wikivoyage-Logo-v3-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Justus_Sustermans_-_Portrait_of_Galileo_Galilei%2C_1636.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/Hevelius_and_wife.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Meissner_effect_p1390048.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Karl_Popper.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Acad%C3%A9mie_des_Sciences_1671.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/DNA_Overview2_crop.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Clinton%261998NobelLaureates.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Michelsonmorley-boxplot.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/MenOfScience1807ZobelAndWalker.jpg"]	f	cover
274	Samuel Taylor Coleridge	Samuel Taylor Coleridge (21 October 1772 – 25 July 1834) was an English poet, literary critic and philosopher who, with his friend William Wordsworth, was a founder of the Romantic Movement in England and a member of the Lake Poets. He wrote the poems The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Kubla Khan, as well as the major prose work Biographia Literaria. His critical work, especially on Shakespeare, was highly influential, and he helped introduce German idealist philosophy to English-speaking culture. He coined many familiar words and phrases, including the celebrated suspension of disbelief. He was a major influence on Emerson, and American transcendentalism.\nThroughout his adult life, Coleridge suffered from crippling bouts of anxiety and depression; it has been speculated by some that he suffered from bipolar disorder, a condition not identified during his lifetime. Coleridge suffered from poor health that may have stemmed from a bout of rheumatic fever and other childhood illnesses. He was treated for these concerns with laudanum, which fostered a lifelong opium addiction.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Sara_Coleridge_1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/SamuelTaylorColeridge.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/KublaKhan.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge_by_Washington_Allston_retouched.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge_-_geograph.org.uk_-_990077.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Albatros_coleridge.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Coleridge.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Ancient_mariner_statue.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge_signature.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge_portrait.jpg"]	f	cover
158	Johannes Kepler	Johannes Kepler (German: [ˈkʰɛplɐ]; December 27, 1571 – November 15, 1630) was a German mathematician, astronomer, and astrologer. A key figure in the 17th century scientific revolution, he is best known for his laws of planetary motion, based on his works Astronomia nova, Harmonices Mundi, and Epitome of Copernican Astronomy. These works also provided one of the foundations for Isaac Newton's theory of universal gravitation.\nDuring his career, Kepler was a mathematics teacher at a seminary school in Graz, Austria, where he became an associate of Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg. Later he became an assistant to astronomer Tycho Brahe, and eventually the imperial mathematician to Emperor Rudolf II and his two successors Matthias and Ferdinand II. He was also a mathematics teacher in Linz, Austria, and an adviser to General Wallenstein. Additionally, he did fundamental work in the field of optics, invented an improved version of the refracting telescope (the Keplerian Telescope), and mentioned the telescopic discoveries of his contemporary Galileo Galilei.\nKepler lived in an era when there was no clear distinction between astronomy and astrology, but there was a strong division between astronomy (a branch of mathematics within the liberal arts) and physics (a branch of natural philosophy). Kepler also incorporated religious arguments and reasoning into his work, motivated by the religious conviction and belief that God had created the world according to an intelligible plan that is accessible through the natural light of reason. Kepler described his new astronomy as "celestial physics", as "an excursion into Aristotle's Metaphysics", and as "a supplement to Aristotle's On the Heavens", transforming the ancient tradition of physical cosmology by treating astronomy as part of a universal mathematical physics.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Unterschrift_Kepler.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Keplers_supernova.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Kepler-solar-system-2.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Kepler-solar-system-1.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Kepler_Mars_retrograde.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Kepler_Drawing_of_SN_1604.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Kepler_Statue_Linz.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Kepler_Optica.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Kepler_track_alpine_ridgeline.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Kepler_conjecture_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Tycho_Brahe.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Stamps_of_Germany_%28DDR%29_1971%2C_MiNr_1649.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Johannes_Kepler_1610.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/House_of_Johannes_Kepler.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Kepler-1619-pl-3.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Karlova_str_No4%2C_Prague_Old_Town.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/AS12-52-7745.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Great_Comet_of_1577.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Brahe_kepler.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Barbara_M%C3%BCller_and_Johannes_Kepler.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Kepler-Wallenstein-Horoskop.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Kepler-Geburtshaus.jpg"]	f	cover
159	Francis Bacon	Francis Bacon, 1st Viscount St. Alban, QC (22 January 1561 – 9 April 1626), was an English philosopher, statesman, scientist, jurist, orator, essayist, and author. He served both as Attorney General and Lord Chancellor of England. After his death, he remained extremely influential through his works, especially as philosophical advocate and practitioner of the scientific method during the scientific revolution.\nBacon has been called the creator of empiricism. His works established and popularised inductive methodologies for scientific inquiry, often called the Baconian method, or simply the scientific method. His demand for a planned procedure of investigating all things natural marked a new turn in the rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, much of which still surrounds conceptions of proper methodology today.\nBacon was knighted in 1603 (being the first scientist to receive a knighthood), and created Baron Verulam in 1618 and Viscount St. Alban in 1621; as he died without heirs, both peerages became extinct upon his death. He famously died by contracting pneumonia while studying the effects of freezing on the preservation of meat.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Lord_Bacon_-_the_guiding_spirit_of_colonization_scheme.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/62/PD-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/York_Water_Gate.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Frontispiece_to_%27The_History_of_the_Royal-Society_of_London%27.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/ShakespeareCandidates1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Bacon_vs_Parliament.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Bacon-Rose.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Francis_Bacon_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Francis_Bacon%2C_Viscount_St_Alban_from_NPG_%282%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/18-year_old_Francis_Bacon.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Pourbus_Francis_Bacon.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Alice_Barnham.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/20040912-001-francis-bacon.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Francis_Bacon_statue%2C_Gray%27s_Inn.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Francis_Bacon_in_the_Library_of_Congress.Jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/StatueOfFrancisBacon.jpg"]	f	cover
160	Deductive reasoning	Deductive reasoning, also deductive logic or logical deduction or, informally, "top-down" logic, is the process of reasoning from one or more general statements (premises) to reach a logically certain conclusion.\nDeductive reasoning links premises with conclusions. If all premises are true, the terms are clear, and the rules of deductive logic are followed, then the conclusion reached is necessarily true.\nDeductive reasoning (top-down logic) contrasts with inductive reasoning (bottom-up logic) in the following way: In deductive reasoning, a conclusion is reached reductively by applying general rules that hold over the entirety of a closed domain of discourse, narrowing the range under consideration until only the conclusion is left. In inductive reasoning, the conclusion is reached by generalizing or extrapolating from initial information. As a result, induction can be used even in an open domain, one where there is epistemic uncertainty. Note, however, that the inductive reasoning mentioned here is not the same as induction used in mathematical proofs – mathematical induction is actually a form of deductive reasoning.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Logic_portal.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg"]	f	cover
161	Idola tribus	Idola tribus (singular Idolum tribus) is a category of logical fallacy, normally translated as "Idols of the Tribe", which refers to a tendency of human nature, to prefer certain types of incorrect conclusions. It a Latin term, coined by Sir Francis Bacon and used in his Novum Organum, one of the earliest treatises arguing the case for the methodical approach of modern science.\nThe term is one of four such "idols" which represent "idols and false notions which are now in possession of the human understanding, and have taken deep root therein, not only so beset men's minds that truth can hardly find entrance, but even after entrance is obtained, they will again in the very instauration of the sciences meet and trouble us, unless men being forewarned of the danger fortify themselves as far as may be against their assaults".\nBesides idola tribus, there are also idola specus, (Idols of the Cave, caused by one's personal peculiarities and experiences) idola fori (Idols of the Market Place, caused by language) and idola theatri (Idols of the Theatre, caused by philosophers).\n\nThe Idols of the Tribe have their foundation in human nature itself, and in the tribe or race of men. For it is a false assertion that the sense of man is the measure of things. On the contrary, all perceptions as well of the sense as of the mind are according to the measure of the individual and not according to the measure of the universe. And the human understanding is like a false mirror, which, receiving rays irregularly, distorts and discolors the nature of things by mingling its own nature with it.\n— Novum Organum, Aphorism XLI\n\nAnd so in this category are cases of people being misled by anthropomorphism. In more detail, Bacon enumerated several specific such barriers to science which are part of human nature, coming into this category:\n"The human understanding is of its own nature prone to suppose the existence of more order and regularity in the world than it finds."\n"The human understanding when it has once adopted an opinion (either as being the received opinion or as being agreeable to itself) draws all things else to support and agree with it."\n"The human understanding is moved by those things most which strike and enter the mind simultaneously and suddenly, and so fill the imagination; and then it feigns and supposes all other things to be somehow, though it cannot see how, similar to those few things by which it is surrounded."\n"The human understanding is unquiet; it cannot stop or rest, and still presses onward, but in vain. Therefore it is that we cannot conceive of any end or limit to the world, but always as of necessity it occurs to us that there is something beyond." Bacon gives as example the Aristotelian doctrine of final cause, which he says has "relation clearly to the nature of man rather than to the nature of the universe; and from this source have strangely defiled philosophy".\n"The human understanding is no dry light, but receives an infusion from the will and affections; whence proceed sciences which may be called "sciences as one would." For what a man had rather were true he more readily believes."\n"But by far the greatest hindrance and aberration of the human understanding proceeds from the dullness, incompetency, and deceptions of the senses; in that things which strike the sense outweigh things which do not immediately strike it, though they be more important."\n"The human understanding is of its own nature prone to abstractions and gives a substance and reality to things which are fleeting."\nBacon said that the Idols of the Tribe "take their rise either from the homogeneity of the substance of the human spirit, or from its preoccupation, or from its narrowness, or from its restless motion, or from an infusion of the affections, or from the incompetency of the senses, or from the mode of impression".	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idola_tribus	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg"]	f	cover
275	Lyrical Ballads	Lyrical Ballads, with a Few Other Poems is a collection of poems by William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, first published in 1798 and generally considered to have marked the beginning of the English Romantic movement in literature. The immediate effect on critics was modest, but it became and remains a landmark, changing the course of English literature and poetry.\nMost of the poems in the 1798 edition were written by Wordsworth, with Coleridge contributing only four poems to the collection, including one of his most famous works, "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner".\nA second edition was published in 1800, in which Wordsworth included additional poems and a preface detailing the pair's avowed poetical principles. Another edition was published in 1802, Wordsworth added an appendix titled Poetic Diction in which he expanded the ideas set forth in the preface.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyrical_Ballads	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Benjamin_Robert_Haydon_002.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Lyrical_Ballads.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Coleridge.jpeg"]	f	cover
167	René Descartes	René Descartes (French: [ʁəne dekaʁt]; Latinized: Renatus Cartesius; adjectival form: "Cartesian"; 31 March 1596 – 11 February 1650) was a French philosopher, mathematician, and writer who spent most of his life in the Dutch Republic. He has been dubbed The Father of Modern Philosophy, and much subsequent Western philosophy is a response to his writings, which are studied closely to this day. In particular, his Meditations on First Philosophy continues to be a standard text at most university philosophy departments. Descartes' influence in mathematics is equally apparent; the Cartesian coordinate system — allowing reference to a point in space as a set of numbers, and allowing algebraic equations to be expressed as geometric shapes in a two-dimensional coordinate system (and conversely, shapes to be described as equations) — was named after him. He is credited as the father of analytical geometry, the bridge between algebra and geometry, crucial to the discovery of infinitesimal calculus and analysis. Descartes was also one of the key figures in the scientific revolution and has been described as an example of genius. He refused to accept the authority of previous philosophers and also refused to accept the obviousness of his own senses.\nDescartes frequently sets his views apart from those of his predecessors. In the opening section of the Passions of the Soul, a treatise on the early modern version of what are now commonly called emotions, Descartes goes so far as to assert that he will write on this topic "as if no one had written on these matters before". Many elements of his philosophy have precedents in late Aristotelianism, the revived Stoicism of the 16th century, or in earlier philosophers like Augustine. In his natural philosophy, he differs from the schools on two major points: First, he rejects the splitting of corporeal substance into matter and form; second, he rejects any appeal to final ends—divine or natural—in explaining natural phenomena. In his theology, he insists on the absolute freedom of God's act of creation.\nDescartes laid the foundation for 17th-century continental rationalism, later advocated by Baruch Spinoza and Gottfried Leibniz, and opposed by the empiricist school of thought consisting of Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Hume. Leibniz, Spinoza and Descartes were all well versed in mathematics as well as philosophy, and Descartes and Leibniz contributed greatly to science as well.\nHe is perhaps best known for the philosophical statement "Cogito ergo sum" (French: Je pense, donc je suis; I think, therefore I am), found in part IV of Discourse on the Method (1637 – written in French but with inclusion of "Cogito ergo sum") and §7 of part I of Principles of Philosophy (1644 – written in Latin).\n\n	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes_i_samtal_med_Sveriges_drottning%2C_Kristina.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/DescartesMeditations.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/DescartesGraduationRegistry.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Frans_Hals_-_Portret_van_Ren%C3%A9_Descartes.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Firma_Descartes.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Cartesian_coordinates_2D.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/DescartesAshes.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Descartes3.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/People_icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Handwritten_letter_by_Descartes_December_1638.jpg"]	f	cover

163	Idola fori	Idola fori (singular Idolum fori), sometimes translated as "Idols of the Market Place" or "Idols of the Forum", are a category of logical fallacy which results from the imperfect correspondences between the word definitions in human languages, and the real things in nature which these words represent. The term was coined in Latin by Sir Francis Bacon and used in his Novum Organum, one of the earliest treatises arguing the case for the logic and method of modern science.\nThe term is one of four such "idols" which represent "idols and false notions which are now in possession of the human understanding, and have taken deep root therein". Because of them, "truth can hardly find entrance" in people's minds, and Bacon predicted that even after the "instauration of the sciences" which he proposes, they will "meet and trouble us, unless men being forewarned of the danger fortify themselves as far as may be against their assaults". They are in other words problems for science, and successful modern scientific method will need to try to avoid them.\nBesides idola fori, there are also idola tribus (Idols of the Tribe, coming from human nature itself), idola specus, (Idols of the cave, coming from the tendencies of particular individuals or groups of people) and idola theatri (Idols of the theatre, caused by the influence of philosophers and systems of thought). Together the four idols are referred to as the Idols of the Mind (Idola mentis).	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idola_fori	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg"]	f	cover
166	Empiricism	Empiricism is a theory which states that knowledge comes only or primarily from sensory experience. One of several views of epistemology, the study of human knowledge, along with rationalism and skepticism, empiricism emphasizes the role of experience and evidence, especially sensory experience, in the formation of ideas, over the notion of innate ideas or traditions; empiricists may argue however that traditions (or customs) arise due to relations of previous sense experiences.\nEmpiricism in the philosophy of science emphasizes evidence, especially as discovered in experiments. It is a fundamental part of the scientific method that all hypotheses and theories must be tested against observations of the natural world rather than resting solely on a priori reasoning, intuition, or revelation.\nEmpiricism, often used by natural scientists, asserts that "knowledge is based on experience" and that "knowledge is tentative and probabilistic, subject to continued revision and falsification." One of the epistemological tenets is that sensory experience creates knowledge. The scientific method, including experiments and validated measurement tools, guides empirical research. Empiricism basically says that the world can be measured, and it usually translates into a quantitative design which in itself translates easily to numbers and graphs.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiricism	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/JohnLocke.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/George_Berkeley_by_John_Smibert.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Wm_james.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Avicenna.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/David_Hume.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Charles_Sanders_Peirce_theb3558.jpg"]	f	cover
181	Jonathan Swift	Jonathan Swift (30 November 1667 – 19 October 1745) was an Anglo-Irish satirist, essayist, political pamphleteer (first for the Whigs, then for the Tories), poet and cleric who became Dean of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin.\nHe is remembered for works such as Gulliver's Travels, A Modest Proposal, A Journal to Stella, Drapier's Letters, The Battle of the Books, An Argument Against Abolishing Christianity, and A Tale of a Tub. Swift is regarded by the Encyclopædia Britannica as the foremost prose satirist in the English language, and is less well known for his poetry. Swift originally published all of his works under pseudonyms – such as Lemuel Gulliver, Isaac Bickerstaff, MB Drapier – or anonymously. He is also known for being a master of two styles of satire: the Horatian and Juvenalian styles.\n\n	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Swiftdeathmask.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Jonathan_Swift_signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/St._Patrick%27s_Cathedral_Swift_bust.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Quill_and_ink.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/International_Mag_Jonathan_Swift.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Jonathan_Swift_by_Charles_Jervas_detail.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Jonathan_Swift_-_Project_Gutenberg_eText_18250.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Swift_works.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/St._Patrick%27s_Cathedral_Swift_epitaph.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/CBI_-_Series_B_-_Ten_pound_note.jpg"]	f	cover
169	Determinism	Determinism is the philosophical position that for every event, including human action, exist conditions that could cause no other event. "There are many determinisms, depending upon what pre-conditions are considered to be determinative of an event." Deterministic theories throughout the history of philosophy have sprung from diverse and sometimes overlapping motives and considerations. Some forms of determinism can be empirically tested with ideas from physics and its philosophy. Opposing determinism is some kind of indeterminism (otherwise called nondeterminism). Determinism is often contrasted with free will and moral responsibility.\nDeterminism often is taken to mean causal determinism, which in physics is known as cause-and-effect. It is the concept that events within a given paradigm are so causally bound that prior states of any object or event completely determine its later states. This meaning can be distinguished from other varieties of determinism mentioned below.\nOther debates often concern the scope of determined systems, with some maintaining that the entire universe is a single determinate system and others identifying other more limited determinate systems (or multiverse). Numerous historical debates involve many philosophical positions and varieties of determinism, some concerning determinism and free will, technically denoted as compatibilistic (allowing the two to coexist) and incompatibilistic (denying their coexistence is a possibility).\nDeterminism should not be confused with self-determination of human actions by reasons, motives, and desires. Determinism rarely requires that perfect prediction be practically possible.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Gospers_glider_gun.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/MontreGousset001.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/JuliusOttoGrimm-Sculpture.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/People_icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/P_religion_world.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/DeterminismXFreeWill.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Iimatyas.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Double-slit_experiment_results_Tanamura_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Willow_path.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Using_Mobile_Phone_0251.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/HEUraniumC.jpg"]	f	cover
282	Gesamtkunstwerk	A Gesamtkunstwerk (translated as total work of art, ideal work of art, universal artwork, synthesis of the arts, comprehensive artwork, all-embracing art form or total artwork) is a work of art that makes use of all or many art forms or strives to do so. The term is a German word which has come to be accepted in English as a term in aesthetics.\nThe term was first used by the German writer and philosopher K. F. E. Trahndorff in an essay in 1827. That the aesthetic of this inherently Romantic concept preceded the explicit term may be seen in Carl Maria von Weber's enthusiastic review of the opera Undine (1814), a collaboration between E.T.A. Hoffman, who composed the score, and Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué who adapted his own novella Undine for a libretto: Weber admired it in his review as 'an art work complete in itself, in which partial contributions of the related and collaborating arts blend together, disappear, and, in disappearing, somehow form a new world'.\nThe German opera composer Richard Wagner used the term in two 1849 essays. It is unclear whether Wagner knew of Trahndorff's essay. The word has become particularly associated with Wagner's aesthetic ideals.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesamtkunstwerk	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/RobieHouseWindows_ChicagoIL.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg"]	f	cover
193	Immanuel Kant	Immanuel Kant (German: [ɪˈmaːnu̯eːl kant]; 22 April 1724 – 12 February 1804) was a German philosopher who is widely considered to be a central figure of modern philosophy. He argued that human concepts and categories structure our view of the world and its laws, and that reason is the source of morality. His thought continues to have a major influence in contemporary thought, especially in fields such as metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy, and aesthetics.\nKant's major work, the Critique of Pure Reason (Kritik der reinen Vernunft, 1781), aimed to bring reason together with experience and to move beyond what he took to be failures of traditional philosophy and metaphysics. He hoped to end an age of speculation where objects outside experience were seen to support what he saw as futile theories, while resisting the skepticism of thinkers such as David Hume.\nKant proposed a "Copernican Revolution-in-reverse". In simple terms, Kant argued that our experiences are structured by necessary features of our minds. The mind shapes and structures experience so that, on an abstract level, all human experience shares certain essential structural features. Among other things, Kant believed that the concepts of space and time are integral to all human experience, as are our concepts of cause and effect. We never have direct experience of things, the noumenal world, and what we do experience is the phenomenal world as conveyed by our senses. These observations summarize Kant's views upon the subject–object problem.\nKant published other important works on ethics, religion, law, aesthetics, astronomy, and history. These included the Critique of Practical Reason (Kritik der praktischen Vernunft, 1788), the Metaphysics of Morals (Die Metaphysik der Sitten, 1797), which dealt with ethics, and the Critique of Judgment (Kritik der Urteilskraft, 1790), which looks at aesthetics and teleology. He aimed to resolve disputes between empirical and rationalist approaches. The former asserted that all knowledge comes through experience; the latter maintained that reason and innate ideas were prior. Kant argued that experience is purely subjective without first being processed by pure reason. He also said that using reason without applying it to experience only leads to theoretical illusions. The free and proper exercise of reason by the individual was a theme both of the Age of Enlightenment, and of Kant's approaches to the various problems of philosophy.\nHis ideas influenced many thinkers in Germany during his lifetime, and he moved philosophy beyond the debate between the rationalists and empiricists. The philosophers Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Arthur Schopenhauer amended and developed the Kantian system, bringing about German idealism.\nKant is seen as a major figure in the history and development of philosophy. German and European thinking progressed after his time, and his influence still inspires philosophical work today. Twentieth-century thinkers who have been influenced by Kant include Max Weber and Friedrich Meinecke.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/People_icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Kant_foto.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3f/Immanuel_Kant_3.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Immanuel_Kant.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/German_5_DM_1974_D_Silver_Coin_Immanuel_Kant.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Immanuel_Kant_Tomb.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Immanuel_Kant_%28painted_portrait%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Ambox_question.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/DBP_-_250_Jahre_Immanuel_Kant_-_90_Pfennig_-_1974.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Autograph-ImmanuelKant.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Kant_Kaliningrad.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Immanuelkant.JPG"]	f	cover
172	Robert Hooke	Robert Hooke FRS (/hʊk/; 28 July [O.S. 18 July] 1635 – 3 March 1703) was an English natural philosopher, architect and polymath.\nHis adult life comprised three distinct periods: as a scientific inquirer lacking money; achieving great wealth and standing through his reputation for hard work and scrupulous honesty following the great fire of 1666, but eventually becoming ill and party to jealous intellectual disputes. These issues may have contributed to his relative historical obscurity.\nHe was at one time simultaneously the curator of experiments of the Royal Society and a member of its council, Gresham Professor of Geometry and a Surveyor to the City of London after the Great Fire of London, in which capacity he appears to have performed more than half of all the surveys after the fire. He was also an important architect of his time – though few of his buildings now survive and some of those are generally misattributed – and was instrumental in devising a set of planning controls for London whose influence remains today. Allan Chapman has characterised him as "England's Leonardo".\nRobert Gunther's Early Science in Oxford, a history of science in Oxford during the Protectorate, Restoration and Age of Enlightenment, devotes five of its fourteen volumes to Hooke.\nHooke studied at Wadham College during the Protectorate where he became one of a tightly knit group of ardent Royalists led by John Wilkins. Here he was employed as an assistant to Thomas Willis and to Robert Boyle, for whom he built the vacuum pumps used in Boyle's gas law experiments. He built some of the earliest Gregorian telescopes and observed the rotations of Mars and Jupiter. In 1665 he inspired the use of microscopes for scientific exploration with his book, Micrographia. Based on his microscopic observations of fossils, Hooke was an early proponent of biological evolution. He investigated the phenomenon of refraction, deducing the wave theory of light, and was the first to suggest that matter expands when heated and that air is made of small particles separated by relatively large distances. He performed pioneering work in the field of surveying and map-making and was involved in the work that led to the first modern plan-form map, though his plan for London on a grid system was rejected in favour of rebuilding along the existing routes. He also came near to an experimental proof that gravity follows an inverse square law, and hypothesised that such a relation governs the motions of the planets, an idea which was subsequently developed by Newton. Much of Hooke's scientific work was conducted in his capacity as curator of experiments of the Royal Society, a post he held from 1662, or as part of the household of Robert Boyle.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hooke	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/RobertHookeMicrographia1665.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/HookeFlea01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Saturn_Robert_Hooke_1666.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Hooke_Microscope-03000276-FIG-4.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Hooke-microscope.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Louse_diagram%2C_Micrographia%2C_Robert_Hooke%2C_1667.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Jan_Baptist_van_Helmont_portrait.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/13_Portrait_of_Robert_Hooke.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Robert_Boyle_0001.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Christiaan_Huygens-painting.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Anchor_Escapement.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Moon_Micrographia_Hooke.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/MK_WillenChurch01.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg"]	f	cover
195	Freemasonry	Freemasonry is a fraternal organisation that traces its origins to the local fraternities of stonemasons, which from the end of the fourteenth century regulated the qualifications of masons and their interaction with authorities and clients. The degrees of freemasonry, its gradal system, retain the three grades of medieval craft guilds, those of Apprentice, journeyman or fellow (now called Fellowcraft), and Master Mason. These are the degrees offered by craft, or blue lodge Freemasonry. There are additional degrees, which vary with locality and jurisdiction, and are now administered by different bodies than the craft degrees.\nThe basic, local organisational unit of Freemasonry is the lodge. The lodges are usually supervised and governed at the regional level (usually coterminous with either a state, province, or national border) by a Grand Lodge or Grand Orient.

174	Antoine Lavoisier	Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier (also Antoine Lavoisier after the French Revolution; 26 August 1743 – 8 May 1794; French pronunciation: ​[ɑ̃twan lɔʁɑ̃ də lavwazje]) was a French nobleman and chemist central to the 18th-century Chemical Revolution and a large influence on both the histories of chemistry and biology. He is widely considered to be the "Father of Modern Chemistry."\nIt is generally accepted that Lavoisier's great accomplishments in chemistry largely stem from the fact that he changed the science from a qualitative to a quantitative one. Lavoisier is most noted for his discovery of the role oxygen plays in combustion. He recognized and named oxygen (1778) and hydrogen (1783) and opposed the phlogiston theory. Lavoisier helped construct the metric system, wrote the first extensive list of elements, and helped to reform chemical nomenclature. He predicted the existence of silicon (1787) and was also the first to establish that sulfur was an element (1777) rather than a compound. He discovered that, although matter may change its form or shape, its mass always remains the same.\nLavoisier was an administrator of the Ferme Générale and a powerful member of a number of other aristocratic councils. All of these political and economic activities enabled him to fund his scientific research. At the height of the French Revolution, he was accused by Jean-Paul Marat of selling adulterated tobacco and of other crimes, and was eventually guillotined a year after Marat's death.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Lavoisier	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Lavoisier_humanexp.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Lavoisier_decomposition_air.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/55/Calorimeter.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Prinsenvlag.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Flag_of_Spain_%281785-1873_and_1875-1931%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Flag_of_Prussia_1892-1918.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Laboratoire-de-Lavoisier.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Antoine_Lavoisier_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Priestley.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/David_-_Portrait_of_Monsieur_Lavoisier_and_His_Wife.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Antoine_lavoisier_color.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Lavoisier_cour_Napoleon_Louvre.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Lavoisier-statue.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/SeimiKaisouChemistry.jpg"]	f	cover
176	Age of Enlightenment	The Age of Enlightenment (or simply the Enlightenment or Age of Reason) was a cultural movement of intellectuals beginning in late 17th-century Europe emphasizing reason and individualism rather than tradition. Its purpose was to reform society using reason, to challenge ideas grounded in tradition and faith, and to advance knowledge through the scientific method. It promoted scientific thought, skepticism, and intellectual interchange. The Enlightenment was a revolution in human thought. This new way of thinking was that rational thought begins with clearly stated principles, uses correct logic to arrive at conclusions, tests the conclusions against evidence, and then revises the principles in the light of the evidence.\nEnlightenment thinkers opposed superstition and intolerance. Some Enlightenment thinkers collaborated with Enlightened despots, absolutist rulers who attempted to forcibly put some of the new ideas about government into practice. The ideas of the Enlightenment continue to exert significant influence on the culture, politics, and governments of the Western world.\nOriginating in the 17th Century, it was sparked by philosophers Francis Bacon (1562-1626), Baruch Spinoza (1632–1677), John Locke (1632–1704), Pierre Bayle (1647–1706), Voltaire (1694–1778) and physicist Isaac Newton (1643–1727). Ruling princes often endorsed and fostered these figures and even attempted to apply their ideas of government in what was known as enlightened absolutism. The Scientific Revolution is closely tied to the Enlightenment, as its discoveries overturned many traditional concepts and introduced new perspectives on nature and man's place within it. The Enlightenment flourished until about 1790–1800, at which point the Enlightenment, with its emphasis on reason, gave way to Romanticism, which placed a new emphasis on emotion; a Counter-Enlightenment began to increase in prominence. The Romantics argued that the Enlightenment was reductionistic insofar as it had largely ignored the forces of imagination, mystery, and sentiment.\nIn France, Enlightenment was based in the salons and culminated in the great Encyclopédie (1751–72) edited by Denis Diderot (1713–1784) and (until 1759) Jean le Rond d'Alembert (1717–1783) with contributions by hundreds of leading intellectuals who were called philosophes, notably Voltaire (1694–1778), Rousseau (1712–1778) and Montesquieu (1689–1755). Some 25,000 copies of the 35 volume encyclopedia were sold, half of them outside France. These new intellectual strains would spread to urban centres across Europe, notably England, Scotland, the German states, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Italy, Austria, Spain. It was also very successful in America, where its influence was manifested in the works of Francophiles like Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, among others. It played a major role in the American Revolution. The political ideals of the Enlightenment influenced the American Declaration of Independence, the United States Bill of Rights, the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, and the Polish–Lithuanian Constitution of May 3, 1791.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Europe%2C_1700_-_1714.png	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Voltaire_and_Diderot_at_the_Caf%C3%A9_Procope.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Voltaire_dictionary.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Zoom_lunette_ardente.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Salon_de_Madame_Geoffrin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Sanzio_01_cropped.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Sir_Isaac_Newton_%281643-1727%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Struensee_-_miniature_portrait.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/57/Josef_II_medal.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/Benjamin_Franklin_1767.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Freimaurer_Initiation.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Europe%2C_1700_-_1714.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Georg_Friedrich_H%C3%A4ndel.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Gentleman%27s_Magazine_1731.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/JohnLocke.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Immanuel_Kant_%28painted_portrait%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Oer-Weimarer_Musenhof.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Montesquieu_1.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/Rousseau.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Pierre_Bayle.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Declaration_independence.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Antoine-Laurent_Lavoisier_%28by_Louis_Jean_Desire_Delaistre%29RENEW.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/Alexandre_humboldt.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Buffon_1707-1788.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Baruch_Spinoza_-_Franz_Wulfhagen_-_1664.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/1477-1799_ESTC_titles_per_decade%2C_statistics.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/AdamSmith.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Acad%C3%A9mie_des_Sciences_1671.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Encyclopedie_frontispice_full.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Denis_Diderot_111.PNG"]	f	cover
177	Thomas Hobbes	Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury (5 April 1588 – 4 December 1679), in some older texts Thomas Hobbs of Malmsbury, was an English philosopher, best known today for his work on political philosophy. His 1651 book Leviathan established the foundation for most of Western political philosophy from the perspective of social contract theory.\nThough on rational grounds a champion of absolutism for the sovereign, Hobbes also developed some of the fundamentals of European liberal thought: the right of the individual; the natural equality of all men; the artificial character of the political order (which led to the later distinction between civil society and the state); the view that all legitimate political power must be "representative" and based on the consent of the people; and a liberal interpretation of law which leaves people free to do whatever the law does not explicitly forbid.\nHe was one of the founders of modern political philosophy and political science. His understanding of humans as being matter and motion, obeying the same physical laws as other matter and motion, remains influential; and his account of human nature as self-interested cooperation, and of political communities as being based upon a "social contract" remains one of the major topics of political philosophy.\nIn addition to political philosophy, Hobbes also contributed to a diverse array of other fields, including history, geometry, the physics of gases, theology, ethics, and general philosophy.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Thomas_Hobbes_%28portrait%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Hobbes_de_cive.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Thomas_Hobbes.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Leviathan_by_Thomas_Hobbes.jpg"]	f	cover
179	John Locke	John Locke FRS (/ˈlɒk/; 29 August 1632 – 28 October 1704), was an English philosopher and physician regarded as one of the most influential of Enlightenment thinkers and known as the "Father of Classical Liberalism". Considered one of the first of the British empiricists, following the tradition of Francis Bacon, he is equally important to social contract theory. His work greatly affected the development of epistemology and political philosophy. His writings influenced Voltaire and Rousseau, many Scottish Enlightenment thinkers, as well as the American revolutionaries. His contributions to classical republicanism and liberal theory are reflected in the United States Declaration of Independence.\nLocke's theory of mind is often cited as the origin of modern conceptions of identity and the self, figuring prominently in the work of later philosophers such as Hume, Rousseau, and Kant. Locke was the first to define the self through a continuity of consciousness. He postulated that, at birth, the mind was a blank slate or tabula rasa. Contrary to Cartesian philosophy based on pre-existing concepts, he maintained that we are born without innate ideas, and that knowledge is instead determined only by experience derived from sense perception.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Yellow_flag_waving.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Locke-John-LOC.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Sound-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/People_icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Flickr_-_Jeff_Attaway_-_fish_pole.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/John_Locke_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/JohnLocke.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5e/John_Locke.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg"]	f	cover

456	Brainstorming	Brainstorming is a group or individual creativity technique by which efforts are made to find a conclusion for a specific problem by gathering a list of ideas spontaneously contributed by its member(s). The term was popularized by Alex Faickney Osborn in the 1963 book Applied Imagination. Osborn claimed that brainstorming was more effective than individuals working alone in generating ideas, although more recent research has questioned this conclusion. Today, the term is used as a catch all for all group ideation sessions.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Activity_conducting.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Nicolas_P._Rougier%27s_rendering_of_the_human_brain.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Nicolas_P._Rougier%27s_rendering_of_the_human_brain.png"]	f	cover
454	John Cage	Not to be confused with John Cale.\n\nJohn Milton Cage Jr. (September 5, 1912 – August 12, 1992) was an American composer, music theorist, writer, and artist. A pioneer of indeterminacy in music, electroacoustic music, and non-standard use of musical instruments, Cage was one of the leading figures of the post-war avant-garde. Critics have lauded him as one of the most influential American composers of the 20th century. He was also instrumental in the development of modern dance, mostly through his association with choreographer Merce Cunningham, who was also Cage's romantic partner for most of their lives.\nCage is perhaps best known for his 1952 composition 4′33″, which is performed in the absence of deliberate sound; musicians who present the work do nothing aside from being present for the duration specified by the title. The content of the composition is not "four minutes and 33 seconds of silence," as is sometimes assumed, but rather the sounds of the environment heard by the audience during performance. The work's challenge to assumed definitions about musicianship and musical experience made it a popular and controversial topic both in musicology and the broader aesthetics of art and performance. Cage was also a pioneer of the prepared piano (a piano with its sound altered by objects placed between or on its strings or hammers), for which he wrote numerous dance-related works and a few concert pieces. The best known of these is Sonatas and Interludes (1946–48).\nHis teachers included Henry Cowell (1933) and Arnold Schoenberg (1933–35), both known for their radical innovations in music, but Cage's major influences lay in various East and South Asian cultures. Through his studies of Indian philosophy and Zen Buddhism in the late 1940s, Cage came to the idea of aleatoric or chance-controlled music, which he started composing in 1951. The I Ching, an ancient Chinese classic text on changing events, became Cage's standard composition tool for the rest of his life. In a 1957 lecture, Experimental Music, he described music as "a purposeless play" which is "an affirmation of life – not an attempt to bring order out of chaos nor to suggest improvements in creation, but simply a way of waking up to the very life we're living".	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cage	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/68/John_Cage_portrait.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1e/Cage-widow-excerpt.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Sharp.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Office-book.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/TudorCageShiraz1971.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Sonatas-interludes-sonata3graph.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/King_Wen_%28I_Ching%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/John_Cage_and_Michael_Bach_in_Assissi_1992.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/ba/Cage-variations-iii-14-small.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8d/Cage-cheap-imitation-exceprt.ogg"]	f	cover

289	Richard Arkwright	Sir Richard Arkwright (23 December 1732 – 3 August 1792) was a self-made man and a leading entrepreneur during the early Industrial Revolution. Although the patents were eventually overturned, he is credited with inventing the spinning frame, which, following the transition to water power was renamed the water frame. He also patented a rotary carding engine that transformed raw cotton into cotton lap.\nArkwright's achievement was to combine power, machinery, semi-skilled labour and the new raw material (cotton) to create mass-produced yarn. His skills of organisation made him, more than anyone else, the creator of the modern factory system, especially in his mill at Cromford. Later in his life Arkwright was known as 'the Father of the Industrial Revolution'.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Sir_Richard_Arkwright_by_Mather_Brown_1790.jpeg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Arkwright	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Sir_Richard_Arkwright_by_Mather_Brown_1790.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Arkright%27s_Mill_-_Cromford_29-04-06.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Arkwright_Richard_1790.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Arkwright-water-frame.jpg"]	f	50%
372	Henri Matisse	Henri-Émile-Benoît Matisse (French: [ɑ̃ʁi matis]; 31 December 1869 – 3 November 1954) was a French artist, known for his use of colour and his fluid and original draughtsmanship. He was a draughtsman, printmaker, and sculptor, but is known primarily as a painter. Matisse is commonly regarded, along with Pablo Picasso and Marcel Duchamp, as one of the three artists who helped to define the revolutionary developments in the plastic arts in the opening decades of the twentieth century, responsible for significant developments in painting and sculpture. Although he was initially labelled a Fauve (wild beast), by the 1920s he was increasingly hailed as an upholder of the classical tradition in French painting. His mastery of the expressive language of colour and drawing, displayed in a body of work spanning over a half-century, won him recognition as a leading figure in modern art.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8f/Henri_Matisse_Self-Portrait_in_a_Striped_T-shirt_%281906%29.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Matisse	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/ce/Henri_Matisse%2C_1907%2C_La_coiffure%2C_116_x_89_cm%2C_oil_on_canvas%2C_Staatsgalerie%2C_Stuttgart.jpg",

291	Luddite	The Luddites were 19th-century English textile artisans who protested against newly developed labour-saving machinery from 1811 to 1817. The stocking frames, spinning frames and power looms introduced during the Industrial Revolution threatened to replace the artisans with less-skilled, low-wage labourers, leaving them without work.\nAlthough the origin of the name Luddite (/ˈlʌd.aɪt/) is uncertain, a popular theory is that the movement was named after Ned Ludd, a youth who allegedly smashed two stocking frames in 1779, and whose name had become emblematic of machine destroyers. The name evolved into the imaginary General Ludd or King Ludd, a figure who, like Robin Hood, was reputed to live in Sherwood Forest.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/FrameBreaking-1812.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/FrameBreaking-1812.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Wikiversity-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Luddite.jpg"]	f	cover
502	American literature	American literature is theliterature written or produced in the area of the United States and its preceding colonies. For more specific discussions of poetry and theater, see Poetry of the United States and Theater in the United States. During its early history, America was a series of British colonies on the eastern coast of the present-day United States. Therefore, its literary tradition begins as linked to the broader tradition of English literature. However, unique American characteristics and the breadth of its production usually now cause it to be considered a separate path and tradition.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Washington_Irving_and_his_Literary_Friends_at_Sunnyside.jpg/640px-Washington_Irving_and_his_Literary_Friends_at_Sunnyside.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_literature	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Washington_Irving_and_his_Literary_Friends_at_Sunnyside.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c2/Whitman-young.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Toni_Morrison%2C_1986.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Jonathan_Franzen_at_the_Brooklyn_Book_Festival.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/John_Updike_with_Bushes_new.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Nathaniel_Hawthorne_old.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/MarkTwain1907.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Books-aj.svg_aj_ashton_01.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Francis_Scott_Fitzgerald_1937_June_4_%281%29_%28photo_by_Carl_van_Vechten%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Edgar_Allan_Poe_portrait.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson_ca1857.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Normanmailer.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Ernest_Hemingway_in_Milan_1918_retouched_3.jpg"]	f	cover

202	Pragmatic sanction	A pragmatic sanction is a sovereign's solemn decree on a matter of primary importance and has the force of fundamental law. In the late history of the Holy Roman Empire it referred more specifically to an edict issued by the Emperor.\nWhen used as a proper noun, and the year is not mentioned, it usually refers to the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713, a legal mechanism designed to ensure that the Austrian throne and Habsburg lands would be inherited by Emperor Charles VI's daughter, Maria Theresa.\nPragmatic sanctions tend to be issued at times in which the theoretically ideal situation is untenable, and a change of the rules is called for.\nThe Pragmatic Sanction of Justinian I, promulgated in August 554, on the reorganization of Italy following the Gothic War.\nThe so-called Pragmatic Sanction of Louis IX, purporting to have been issued in March 1269, regarding various clerical reforms, was a forgery fabricated in the 15th century.\nThe Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges, issued on July 7, 1438 by King Charles VII of France, limited the authority of the pope over the Church within France.\nThe German Pragmatic Sanction of 1439, issued by German ruling princes March 26, 1439, accepted some of the decrees of the Council of Basel with modifications. It has been argued that the name Pragmatic Sanction is not properly applied to this document, as it was issued by princes subordinate to the emperor without the emperor's endorsement.\nThe Pragmatic Sanction of 1549, issued by Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, established the Seventeen Provinces as an entity separate from the Empire and from France.\nThe Croatian Pragmatic Sanction was a law of Diet of Kingdom of Croatia allowing female inheritance of Throne of Croatia if Charles VI had no male heirs.\nThe Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 issued by Emperor Charles VI on April 19, 1713.\nThe Pragmatic Sanction voted by the Hungarian Parliament in 1723 in which the Kingdom of Hungary accepted female inheritance, allowing Austrian empress Maria Theresa to become queen of Hungary.\nThe Pragmatic Sanction of Naples, issued October 6, 1759, by King Charles III of Spain, governed the succession to the thrones of Naples, Sicily, and Spain, and forbade the union of Spain and the Two Sicilies.\nThe Spanish Pragmatic Sanction of 1830, issued March 29, 1830 by King Ferdinand VII of Spain, ratified a Decree of 1789 by Charles IV of Spain, which had replaced the semi-Salic system established by Philip V with the mixed succession system that had characterized historically the Castilian monarchy (upon which the Spanish monarchy draws its traditions), as noted by the inheritance by queens regnant Urraca of Castile, Isabella I of Castile, and Joanna I of Castile.

418	Douglas MacArthur	"General MacArthur" and "Douglas McArthur" redirect here. For the Canadian politician, see Douglas Francis McArthur. For his nephew the diplomat, see Douglas MacArthur II. For other uses, see General MacArthur (disambiguation).\n\nGeneral of the Army Douglas MacArthur (26 January 1880 – 5 April 1964) was an American general and field marshal of the Philippine Army who was Chief of Staff of the United States Army during the 1930s and played a prominent role in the Pacific theater during World War II. He received the Medal of Honor for his service in the Philippines Campaign, which made him and his father Arthur MacArthur, Jr., the first father and son to be awarded the medal. He was one of only five men ever to rise to the rank of General of the Army in the U.S. Army, and the only man ever to become a field marshal in the Philippine Army.\nRaised in a military family in the American Old West, MacArthur was valedictorian at the West Texas Military Academy, and First Captain at the United States Military Academy at West Point, where he graduated top of the class of 1903. During the 1914 United States occupation of Veracruz, he conducted a reconnaissance mission, for which he was nominated for the Medal of Honor. In 1917, he was promoted from major to colonel and became chief of staff of the 42nd (Rainbow) Division. In the fighting on the Western Front during World War I, he rose to the rank of brigadier general, was again nominated for a Medal of Honor, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross twice and the Silver Star seven times.\nFrom 1919 to 1922, MacArthur served as Superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, where he attempted a series of reforms. His next assignment was in the Philippines, where in 1924 he was instrumental in quelling the Philippine Scout Mutiny. In 1925, he became the Army's youngest major general. He served on the court martial of Brigadier General Billy Mitchell and was president of the American Olympic Committee during the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. In 1930, he became Chief of Staff of the United States Army. As such, he was involved in the expulsion of the Bonus Army protesters from Washington, D.C. in 1932, and the establishment and organization of the Civilian Conservation Corps. He retired from the U.S. Army in 1937 to become Military Advisor to the Commonwealth Government of the Philippines.\nMacArthur was recalled to active duty in 1941 as commander of United States Army Forces in the Far East. A series of disasters followed, starting with the destruction of his air forces on 8 December 1941, and the invasion of the Philippines by the Japanese. MacArthur's forces were soon compelled to withdraw to Bataan, where they held out until May 1942. In March 1942, MacArthur, his family and his staff left nearby Corregidor Island in PT boats and escaped to Australia, where MacArthur became Supreme Commander, Southwest Pacific Area. For his defense of the Philippines, MacArthur was awarded the Medal of Honor. After more than two years of fighting in the Pacific, he fulfilled a promise to return to the Philippines. He officially accepted Japan's surrender on 2 September 1945, and oversaw the occupation of Japan from 1945 to 1951.

207	Charles Edward Stuart	Charles Edward Louis John Casimir Sylvester Severino Maria Stuart (31 December 1720 – 31 January 1788), commonly known in Britain during his lifetime as The Young Pretender, and often referred to in retrospective accounts as Bonnie Prince Charlie, was the second Jacobite pretender to the thrones of England, Scotland, and Ireland. This claim was as the eldest son of James Francis Edward Stuart, himself the son of James II of England. Charles is perhaps best known as the instigator of the unsuccessful Jacobite uprising of 1745, in which he led an insurrection to restore his family to the throne of the Kingdom of Great Britain, which ended in defeat at the Battle of Culloden that effectively ended the Jacobite cause. Charles's flight from Scotland after the uprising has rendered him a romantic figure of heroic failure in some later representations. In 1759 he was involved in a French plan to invade Britain which was abandoned following British naval victories.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Charles_Edward_Stuart_%281775%29.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Edward_Stuart	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/William_Mosman_-_Prince_Charles_Edward_Stuart%2C_1720_-_1788._Eldest_son_of_Prince_James_Francis_Edward_Stuart_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Lost_Portrait_of_Charles_Edward_Stuart.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Jacobite_Standard_%281745%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Marie-Victoire_Princess_de_Rohan.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Louise%2C_Countess_d%27Albany.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Bonnie_Prince_Charlie_by_John_Pettie.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/CharlotteStuart.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Charles_Edward_Stuart_%281775%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/C_Walkinshaw.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/91/Bonnie_A.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/The_Battle_of_Culloden.jpg"]	f	cover
210	Rococo	Rococo (/rəˈkoʊkoʊ/ or /roʊkəˈkoʊ/), less commonly roccoco, or "Late Baroque", is an 18th-century artistic movement and style, which affected several aspects of the arts including painting, sculpture, architecture, interior design, decoration, literature, music and theatre. The Rococo developed in the early part of the 18th century in Paris, France as a reaction against the grandeur, symmetry and strict regulations of the Baroque, especially that of the Palace of Versailles. In such a way, Rococo artists opted for a more jocular, florid and graceful approach to Baroque art and architecture. Rococo art and architecture in such a way was ornate and made strong usage of creamy, pastel-like colours, asymmetrical designs, curves and gold. Unlike the more politically focused Baroque, the Rococo had more playful and often witty artistic themes. With regard to interior decoration, Rococo rooms were designed as total works of art with elegant and ornate furniture, small sculptures, ornamental mirrors, and tapestry complementing architecture, reliefs, and wall paintings. The Rococo additionally played an important role in theatre. In the book The Rococo, it is written that there was no other culture which "has produced a wittier, more elegant, and teasing dialogue full of elusive and camouflaging language and gestures, refined feelings and subtle criticism" than Rococo theatre, especially that of France.\nTowards the end of the 18th century, Rococo started to fall out of fashion, and it was largely supplanted by the Neoclassic style. In 1835 the Dictionary of the French Academy stated that the word Rococo "usually covers the kind of ornament, style and design associated with Louis XV's reign and the beginning of that of Louis XVI". It includes therefore, all types of art produced around the middle of the 18th century in France. The word Rococo is seen as a combination of the French rocaille, meaning stone, and coquilles, meaning shell, due to reliance on these objects as motifs of decoration. The term Rococo may also be interpreted as a combination of the Italian word "barocco" (an irregularly shaped pearl, possibly the source of the word "baroque") and the French "rocaille" (a popular form of garden or interior ornamentation using shells and pebbles), and may be used to describe the refined and fanciful style that became fashionable in parts of Europe during the eighteenth century. Owing to Rococo love of shell-like curves and focus on decorative arts, some critics used the term to derogatively imply that the style was frivolous or merely modish. When the term was first used in English in about 1836, it was a colloquialism meaning "old-fashioned". As a matter of fact, the style received harsh criticism, and was seen by some to be superficial and of poor taste, especially when compared to neoclassicism; despite this, it has been praised for its aesthetic qualities, and since the mid-19th century, the term has been accepted by art historians. While there is still some debate about the historical significance of the style to art in general, Rococo is now widely recognized as a major period in the development of European art.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rococo	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Vanloo%2C_Triumph_of_Galatea.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Tomb_effigy_of_Amalia_Mniszech_in_Saint_Mary_Magdalene_Church_in_Dukla.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Zwiefalten_28_04_2011_23.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/33/Del_rei_igreja.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Marie167.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Mondon_le_Fils.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/L%27Embarquement_pour_Cythere%2C_by_Antoine_Watteau%2C_from_C2RMF_retouched.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/La_muerte_de_Jacinto_by_Giambattista_Tiepolo.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Louis-Michel_van_Loo_001.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Ludwigsbg_mirror.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Gruber_Manor._staircase.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/JAMeissonnierTable.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Jean-Baptiste_Sim%C3%A9on_Chardin_029.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Kauffman-Garrick.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0b/FdeTroyLectureMoliere.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/WatteauPierrot.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/WPVA-khamsa.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Dom_u_Dobreho_pastiera01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Portrait_d%27homme%2C_anciennement_portrait_de_Denis_Diderot_par_Fragonard.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Fragonard_-_swing.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Fragonard%2C_Inspiration.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Franz_Anton_Bustelli_Liebesgruppe_1756-4.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Francis_Hayman_001.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Fran%C3%A7ois_Boucher_002.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Fran%C3%A7ois_Boucher%2C_Ruhendes_M%C3%A4dchen_%281751%2C_Wallraf-Richartz_Museum%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Greuze%2C_Jean-Baptiste_-_The_Spoiled_Child_-_low_res.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Gau1878.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/The_Toilet_of_Venus%2C_by_Fran%C3%A7ois_Boucher.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/The_Progress_of_Love_-_The_Meeting_-_Fragonard_1771-72.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Tettnang_Neues_Schloss_Treppenhaus_Stuck_3.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/St._Andriy%27s_Church_in_Kyiv.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Reynolds.clive.750pix.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Queluz_Palace_fountains.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Portrait_d%27homme%2C_anciennement_portrait_de_Denis_Diderot_par_Fragonard.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Pompadour6.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/PalaisCatherine-facade.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Mr_and_Mrs_Andrews_1748-49.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/BasilikaOttobeurenHauptschiff02.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Antoine_Watteau_-_L%27imbarco_per_Citera.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Boucher_Marquise_de_Pompadour_1756.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Boucher_Diane_sortant_du_bain_Louvre_2712.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/6_Warszawa_159.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Allegories_of_astronomy_and_geography.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/A._Avelin_after_Mondon_le_Fils.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Charles-Andr%C3%A9%2C_dit_Carle_Vanloo_-_Halte_de_chasse_%281737%29.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Boucher_par_Gustav_Lundberg_1741.jpg"]	f	cover
214	François Boucher	François Boucher (French pronunciation: ​[fʁɑ̃swa buʃe]) (29 September 1703 – 30 May 1770) was a French painter in the Rococo style. Boucher is known for his idyllic and voluptuous paintings on classical themes, decorative allegories, and pastoral scenes. He was perhaps the most celebrated decorative artist of the 18th century. He also painted several portraits of his patroness, Madame de Pompadour.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Boucher	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5b/Boucher_-_Diana.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Fran%C3%A7ois_Boucher_017.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Fran%C3%A7ois_Boucher_007.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Fran%C3%A7ois_Boucher_Autumn_Pastoral.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Fran%C3%A7ois_Boucher_032.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Fran%C3%A7ois_Boucher%2C_Ruhendes_M%C3%A4dchen_%281751%2C_Wallraf-Richartz_Museum%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Marie-Jeanne_Buzeau_by_Alexandre_Roslin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Royal_Standard_of_the_Kingdom_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Nuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/The_Toilet_of_Venus%2C_by_Fran%C3%A7ois_Boucher.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Saint_Pierre_tentant_de_marcher_sur_les_eaux_by_Fran%C3%A7ois_Boucher.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Boucher_renaud_et_armide_louvre.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Boucher_par_Gustav_Lundberg_1741.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Fran%C3%A7ois_Boucher_-_%27Putti_with_Birds%27.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Fran%C3%A7ois_Boucher%2C_Ruhendes_M%C3%A4dchen_%281751%2C_Wallraf-Richartz_Museum%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Boucher_Diane_sortant_du_bain_Louvre_2712.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Boucher_Vulcan_Presenting_Venus_with_Arms_for_Aeneas.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Boucher_Marquise_de_Pompadour_1756.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Fran%C3%A7ois_Boucher_003.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Fran%C3%A7ois_Boucher_-_Dreaming_Shepherdess_-_WGA02914.jpg"]	f	cover
226	Excellence	Excellence is a talent or quality which is unusually good and so surpasses ordinary standards. It is also used as a standard of performance as measured e.g. through economic indicators.\nIn modern public relations and marketing, "excellence" is a much overused buzzword that tries to convey a good impression often without imparting any concrete information (e.g. "center for excellence in ...", "business excellence", etc.).	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excellence	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg"]	f	cover
236	United States Constitution	The Constitution of the United States is the supreme law of the United States of America. The Constitution originally consisted of seven Articles. The first three Articles embody the doctrine of the separation of powers, whereby the federal government is divided into three branches: the legislature, consisting of the bicameral Congress; the executive, consisting of the President; and the judiciary, consisting of the Supreme Court and other federal courts. The fourth and sixth Articles frame the doctrine of federalism, describing the relationship between State and State, and between the several States and the federal government. The fifth Article provides the procedure for amending the Constitution. The seventh Article provides the procedure for ratifying the Constitution.\nThe Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787, by the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and ratified by conventions in eleven States. It went into effect on March 4, 1789.\nSince the Constitution was adopted, it has been amended twenty-seven times. The first ten amendments (along with two others that were not ratified at the time) were proposed by Congress on September 25, 1789, and were ratified by the necessary three-fourths of the States on December 15, 1791. These first ten amendments are known as the Bill of Rights.\nThe Constitution is interpreted, supplemented, and implemented by a large body of constitutional law. The Constitution of the United States was the first constitution of its kind, and has influenced the constitutions of other nations. Research has shown that this influence may be on the wane, however.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Constitution_We_the_People.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Us_declaration_independence.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Jose_rizal_01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/William_Rehnquist.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/John_Marshall_by_Henry_Inman%2C_1832.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Scene_at_the_Signing_of_the_Constitution_of_the_United_States.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Proposed_Amendments_to_the_U.S._Constitution_as_Passed_by_the_Senate%2C_Printed_September_14%2C_1789.djvu", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Sound-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Senate_Revisions_to_House_Proposed_Amendments_to_the_U.S._Constitution.djvu", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/01/A_coloured_voting_box.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Sun_Yat_Sen_portrait_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/William_Howard_Taft.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Constitution_of_the_United_States%2C_page_1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/John_Jay_%28Gilbert_Stuart_portrait%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Earl_Warren.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Constitution_We_the_People.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/John_Locke_by_Herman_Verelst.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Great_Seal_of_the_United_States_%28obverse%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/13_colonies_in_1775_%28large%29.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Articles_page1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Americas_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Bill_of_Rights_Pg1of1_AC.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/United_States_Constitution_spoken.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Mathew_Brady%2C_Portrait_of_Secretary_of_the_Treasury_Salmon_P._Chase%2C_officer_of_the_United_States_government_%281860%E2%80%931865%2C_full_version%29.jpg"]	f	cover

328	Washington Irving	Washington Irving (April 3, 1783 – November 28, 1859) was an American author, essayist, biographer, historian, and diplomat of the early 19th century. He is best known for his short stories "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" and "Rip Van Winkle", both of which appear in his book The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. His historical works include biographies of George Washington, Oliver Goldsmith and Muhammad, and several histories of 15th-century Spain dealing with subjects such as Christopher Columbus, the Moors, and the Alhambra. Irving served as the U.S. ambassador to Spain from 1842 to 1846.\nHe made his literary debut in 1802 with a series of observational letters to the Morning Chronicle, written under the pseudonym Jonathan Oldstyle. After moving to England for the family business in 1815, he achieved international fame with the publication of The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. in 1819–20. He continued to publish regularly—and almost always successfully—throughout his life, and completed a five-volume biography of George Washington just eight months before his death, at age 76, in Tarrytown, New York.\nIrving, along with James Fenimore Cooper, was among the first American writers to earn acclaim in Europe, and Irving encouraged American authors such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Edgar Allan Poe. Irving was also admired by some European writers, including Walter Scott, Lord Byron, Thomas Campbell, Francis Jeffrey, and Charles Dickens. As America's first genuine internationally best-selling author, Irving advocated for writing as a legitimate profession, and argued for stronger laws to protect American writers from copyright infringement.	\N	\N	\N	http://www.nndb.com/people/815/000031722/irving-crop.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Irving	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/TheSketchbookTitlePage.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Sunnyside%2C_Tarrytown%2C_New_York.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Washington_Irving2_1940_Issue-1c.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/John_Quidor_-_Headless_Horseman_Pursuing_Ichabod_Crane_-_Smithsonian.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Irvington_bust_of_Wasington_Irving.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Portrait_of_Washington_Irving_attr._to_Charles_Robert_Leslie.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/L1020117.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Alhambra_view.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Wash_Irving_bust_PP_jeh.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Irving-Washington-LOC.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Diedrich_Knickerbocker.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Washington_Irving_and_his_Literary_Friends_at_Sunnyside.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Portrait_of_Washington_Irving_by_John_Wesley_Jarvis_in_1809.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Washington_Irving_Signature.svg"]	f	70%
224	Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart	Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (German: [ˈvɔlfɡaŋ amaˈdeus ˈmoːtsaʁt], English see fn.; 27 January 1756 – 5 December 1791), baptised as Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart, was a prolific and influential composer of the Classical era.\nMozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. At 17, he was engaged as a court musician in Salzburg, but grew restless and travelled in search of a better position, always composing abundantly. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his death. The circumstances of his early death have been much mythologized. He was survived by his wife Constanze and two sons.\nHe composed over 600 works, many acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral music. He is among the most enduringly popular of classical composers, and his influence on subsequent Western art music is profound; Beethoven composed his own early works in the shadow of Mozart, and Joseph Haydn wrote that "posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years."	\N	\N	\N	http://www.nndb.com/people/872/000024800/mozart.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Wolfgang-amadeus-mozart_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Wolfgang-amadeus-mozart_1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Mozart_drawing_Doris_Stock_1789.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Croce-Mozart-Detail.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Mozart_%28unfinished%29_by_Lange_1782.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Mozart_%285%29.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Office-book.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Costanze_Mozart_by_Lange_1782.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Wolfgang01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Martini_bologna_mozart_1777.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Louis_Carrogis_dit_Carmontelle_-_Portrait_de_Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart_%28Salzbourg%2C_1756-Vienne%2C_1791%29_jouant_%C3%A0_Paris_avec_son_p%C3%A8re_Jean..._-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/16/Mozart_Sheet_Music.jpg"]	f	cover
230	Intolerable Acts	The Intolerable Acts was the Patriots' name for a series of punitive laws passed by the British Parliament, in 1774 relating to Massachusetts after the Boston Tea party. It was meant to punish the colonists for all the money that was wasted when the tea was thrown in the harbor. In Great Britain, these laws were referred to as the Coercive Acts.\nThe acts took away Massachusetts self-government and historic rights, triggering outrage and resistance in the Thirteen Colonies. They were key developments in the outbreak of the American Revolution in 1775.\nFour of the acts were issued in direct response to the Boston Tea Party of December 1773; the British Parliament hoped these punitive measures would, by making an example of Massachusetts, reverse the trend of colonial resistance to parliamentary authority that had begun with the 1765 Stamp Act. A fifth act, the Quebec Act, enlarged the boundaries of what was then the Province of Quebec and instituted reforms generally favorable to the French Catholic inhabitants of the region; although unrelated to the other four Acts, it was passed in the same legislative session and seen by the colonists as one of the Intolerable Acts. The Patriots viewed the acts as an arbitrary violation of the rights of Massachusetts, and in September of 1774 they organized the First Continental Congress to coordinate a protest. As tensions escalated, the American Revolutionary War broke out in April 1775, leading in July 1776 to the creation of an independent United States of America.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intolerable_Acts	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/RapeBoston.jpg"]	f	cover
329	James Fenimore Cooper	James Fenimore Cooper (September 15, 1789 – September 14, 1851) was a prolific and popular American writer of the early 19th century. His historical romances of frontier and Indian life in the early American days created a unique form of American literature. He lived most of his life in Cooperstown, New York, which was established by his father William. Cooper was a lifelong member of the Episcopal Church and in his later years contributed generously to it. He attended Yale University for three years, where he was a member of the Linonian Society, but was expelled for misbehavior. Before embarking on his career as a writer he served in the U.S. Navy as a Midshipman which greatly influenced many of his novels and other writings. He is best remembered as a novelist who wrote numerous sea-stories and the historical novels known as the Leatherstocking Tales. Among naval historians Cooper's works on the early U.S. Navy have been well received, but they were sometimes criticized by his contemporaries. Among his most famous works is the Romantic novel The Last of the Mohicans, often regarded as his masterpiece.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/James_Fenimore_Cooper_by_Jarvis.jpg/250px-James_Fenimore_Cooper_by_Jarvis.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Fenimore_Cooper	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/James_Fenimore_Cooper_by_Jarvis.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/James_Fenimore_Cooper_by_Brady.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Last_of_the_Mohicans%2C_Merrill_bear.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Appletons%27_Cooper_James_Fenimore_Otsego_Hall.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/James_Fenimore_Cooper_Statue.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/James_Fenimore_Cooper.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg"]	f	70%
248	Girondist	The Girondists (French: Girondins, pronounced: [ʒi.ʁɔ̃.dɜ̃]; also called Brissotins [bʁi.sɔ̃.tɜ̃]) were a political faction in France in 1792-1793 within the Legislative Assembly and the National Convention during the French Revolution. They campaigned for the end of the monarchy but then resisted the spiraling momentum of the Revolution. They came into conflict with The Mountain (Montagnards, a more radical faction within the Jacobin Club). This conflict eventually led to the fall of the Girondists and their mass execution, the beginning of the Reign of Terror. The Girondists comprised a group of loosely-affiliated individuals rather than an organized political party, and the name was at first informally applied because the most prominent exponents of their point of view were deputies to the States-general from the department of Gironde in southwest France. The term became standard with Lamartine's history in 1847.\nGirondist leader Jacques-Pierre Brissot proposed an ambitious military plan to spread the Revolution—one that Napoleon later achieved. He called on the Convention to dominate Western Europe by conquering the Rhineland, Poland, and Holland, with a goal of creating a protective ring of satellite republics in Britain, Spain and Italy by 1795. The Girondists were thus the war party in 1792-93. Other prominent Girondists included Jean Marie Roland and his wife Madame Roland. They had an ally in American activist Thomas Paine. Brissot and Madame Roland were executed and Jean Roland (who had gone into hiding) committed suicide when he learned what had transpired. Paine was arrested and imprisoned but narrowly escaped execution. The famous painting Death of Marat depicts the killing of fiery radical journalist (and denouncer of the Girondists) Jean-Paul Marat by the Girondist sympathizer Charlotte Corday, who was executed.	\N	\N	\N	https://mcrobrevolution.wikispaces.com/file/view/girondins.jpg/33780407/331x265/girondins.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girondist	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/62/PD-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/GirondistsForce.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/GirondistsExecution.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Prinsenvlag.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Madame_Roland.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Flag_of_Prussia_1892-1918.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Flag_of_Spain_%281785-1873_and_1875-1931%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg"]	f	cover
332	Herman Melville	Herman Melville (August 1, 1819 – September 28, 1891) was an American novelist, poet, and writer of short stories. His contributions to the Western canon are the whaling novel Moby-Dick (1851); the short work Bartleby, the Scrivener (1853) about a clerk in a Wall Street office; the slave ship narrative Benito Cereno (1855); and Billy Budd, Sailor. When asked which of the great American writers he most admired, Vladimir Nabokov replied: "When I was young I liked Poe, and I still love Melville, whom I did not read as a boy."\nAround his twentieth year he was a schoolteacher for a short time, then became a seaman when his father met business reversals. On his first voyage he jumped ship in the Marquesas Islands, where he lived for a time. His first book, an account of that time, Typee, became a bestseller and Melville became known as the "man who lived among the cannibals". After Omoo, the sequel to his first book, Melville began to work philosophical issues in his third book, the elaborate Mardi (1849). The public indifference to Moby-Dick (1851), and Pierre (1852), put an end to his career as a popular author. From 1853 to 1856 he wrote short fiction for magazines, collected as The Piazza Tales (1856). In 1857, Melville published The Confidence-Man, the last work of fiction published during his lifetime. During his later decades, Melville worked at the New York Customs House and privately published some volumes of poetry in editions of only 25 copies. When he died in 1891, Melville was almost completely forgotten. It was not until the "Melville Revival" at the occasion of the centennial of his birth that his work won recognition. In 1924, the story Billy Budd, Sailor was published, which Melville worked on during his final years, and left in manuscript at his death.\nThe single most Melvillean characteristic of his prose is its allusiveness. Difficult as it may seem to assess either the essence or the greatness of Melville's achievement, pioneering scholar of American literature Stanley T. Williams made it look easy by doing both in the same sentence: "In Melville's manipulation of his reading was a transforming power comparable to Shakespeare's."	\N	\N	\N	http://www.todayifoundout.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Moby-Dick-3.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Melville	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Melville_obit.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Herman_Melville_1885.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Herman_Melville_1860.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Herman_Melville_profile.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Herman_Melville_Headstone_1024.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Arrowhead_farmhouse_Herman_Melville.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Herman_Melville_1846-47.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Herman_Melville.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Melville_New_York_Home.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Herman_Melville_signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg"]	f	cover
432	Harry S. Truman	Harry S. Truman (May 8, 1884 – December 26, 1972) was the 33rd President of the United States of America (1945–1953). The final running mate of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944, Truman succeeded to the presidency on April 12, 1945, when Roosevelt died after months of declining health. Under Truman, the U.S. successfully concluded World War II; in the aftermath of the conflict, tensions with the Soviet Union increased, marking the start of the Cold War.\nTruman was born in Missouri, and spent most of his youth on his family's farm. During World War I, Truman served in combat in France as an artillery officer in his National Guard unit. After the war, he briefly owned a haberdashery and joined the Democratic Party political machine of Tom Pendergast in Kansas City, Missouri. He was first elected to public office as a county official, and in 1935 became U.S. senator. He gained national prominence as head of the wartime Truman Committee, which exposed waste, fraud, and corruption in wartime contracts.\nWhile Germany surrendered a few weeks after Truman assumed the Presidency, the war with Japan was expected to last another year or more. Truman ordered the use of atomic weapons against Japan, intending to force Japan's surrender and spare American lives in an invasion; the decision remains controversial. His presidency was a turning point in foreign affairs, as the nation supported an internationalist foreign policy in conjunction with European allies. Working closely with Congress, Truman assisted in the founding of the United Nations, issued the Truman Doctrine to contain communism, and passed the $13 billion Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe, including the Axis Powers of both world wars, whereas the wartime ally Soviet Union became the peacetime enemy, and the Cold War began. He oversaw the Berlin Airlift in 1948 and the creation of NATO in 1949. When communist North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950, he immediately sent in U.S. troops and gained UN approval for the Korean War. After initial success, the UN forces were thrown back by Chinese intervention and the conflict was stalemated through the final years of Truman's presidency.\nOn domestic issues, bills endorsed by Truman often faced opposition from a conservative Congress dominated by the South, but his administration successfully guided the American economy through post-war economic challenges. He said civil rights was a moral priority, and submitted the first comprehensive legislation in 1948, and issued Executive Orders to start racial integration of the military and federal agencies that year. Corruption in Truman's administration, which was linked to certain members in the cabinet and senior White House staff, was a central issue in the 1952 presidential campaign which Adlai Stevenson, Truman's successor as Democratic nominee, lost to Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower. Popular and scholarly assessments of his presidency were initially negative, but eventually became more positive after his retirement from politics. Truman's 1948 election upset for his full term as president is routinely invoked by underdog candidates.	\N	\N	\N	http://www.nndb.com/people/114/000024042/truman-sm.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Truman	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fe/Chicago_Defender_July_31_1948.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/28/Deweytruman12.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/FDR_in_1933.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Truman_pass-the-buck.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Truman_receives_menorah.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/TrumanFuneralWreath.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/TrumanWedding.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Truman_initiating_Korean_involvement.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/RooseveltTruman1944poster.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Seal_Of_The_President_Of_The_United_States_Of_America.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Seal_of_the_United_States_Senate.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Senate_Desk_Truman.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Heinkel_He_111_during_the_Battle_of_Britain.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Harry_S_Truman_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Nuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Lyndon_Johnson_signing_Medicare_bill%2C_with_Harry_Truman%2C_July_30%2C_1965.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Photograph_of_President_Truman_and_Indian_Prime_Minister_Jawaharlal_Nehru%2C_with_Nehru%27s_sister%2C_Madame_Pandit%2C_waving..._-_NARA_-_200154.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/President_Harry_Truman%2C_Adlai_Stevenson%2C_and_John_Sparkman2.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Photograph_of_President_Truman_in_the_Oval_Office%2C_reading_the_announcement_of_Japan%27s_surrender_to_assembled..._-_NARA_-_199171.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/President_Truman_with_Greek_sponge_divers..jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/President_Truman_and_Prime_Minister_Mohammad_Mossadegh_of_Iran.TIF", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Yellow_flag_waving.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/White-house-1950-interior-shell.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/US_Vice_President_Seal.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/HarryTruman.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Harry-truman.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Harry_S._Truman_WW_I.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Harry_S._Truman%27s_farewell_address_1953.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-29645-0001%2C_Potsdamer_Konferenz%2C_Stalin%2C_Truman%2C_Churchill.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Great_Seal_of_the_United_States_%28obverse%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Harry_S_Truman_-_NARA_-_530677_%282%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Harry_S_TRuman_1973_Issue-8c.jpg"]	f	90%
253	Maximilien de Robespierre	Maximilien François Marie Isidore Robespierre (IPA: [ma.ksi.mi.ljɛ̃ fʁɑ̃.swa ma.ʁi i.zi.dɔʁ də ʁɔ.bɛs.pjɛʁ]; 6 May 1758 – 28 July 1794) was a French lawyer and politician, and one of the best-known and most influential figures of the French Revolution.\nAs a member of the Estates-General, the Constituent Assembly and the Jacobin Club, he advocated against the death penalty and for the abolition of slavery, while supporting equality of rights, universal suffrage and the establishment of a republic. He opposed war with Austria and the possibility of a coup by the Marquis de Lafayette. As a member of the Committee of Public Safety, he was an important figure during the period of the Revolution commonly known as the Reign of Terror, which ended a few months after his arrest and execution in July 1794.\nInfluenced by 18th-century Enlightenment philosophes such as Rousseau and Montesquieu, he was a capable articulator of the beliefs of the left-wing bourgeoisie. His steadfast adherence and defense of the views he expressed earned him the nickname «l'Incorruptible» (The Incorruptible). His reputation has gone through cycles. It peaked in the 1920s when the influential French historian Albert Mathiez rejected the common view of Robespierre as demagogic, dictatorial, and fanatical. Mathiez argued he was an eloquent spokesman for the poor and oppressed, an enemy of royalist intrigues, a vigilant adversary of dishonest and corrupt politicians, a guardian of the French Republic, an intrepid leader of the French Revolutionary government, and a prophet of a socially responsible state. In recent decades, his reputation has suffered from his association with radical purification of politics by the killing of his enemies.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Robespierre.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilien_de_Robespierre	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Robespierre.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/RiotsMay31-June2_1793.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Robespierre_ex%C3%A9cutant_le_bourreau.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Flag_of_Spain_%281785-1873_and_1875-1931%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Louis_Boilly_Robespierre.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/F%C3%AAte_de_l%27Etre_supr%C3%AAme_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/ExaminationLouistheLast.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Robespierre_IMG_2303.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Flag_of_Prussia_1892-1918.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Execution_robespierre%2C_saint_just....jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Signature_de_Maximilien_de_Robespierre.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Prinsenvlag.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/MaxRobespierre_Best.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Shot.jpg"]	f	90%
268	Victor Hugo	Victor Marie Hugo (French pronunciation: ​[viktɔʁ maʁi yɡo]; 26 February 1802 – 22 May 1885) was a French poet, novelist, and dramatist of the Romantic movement. He is considered one of the greatest and best known French writers. In France, Hugo's literary fame comes first from his poetry but also rests upon his novels and his dramatic achievements. Among many volumes of poetry, Les Contemplations and La Légende des siècles stand particularly high in critical esteem. Outside France, his best-known works are the novels Les Misérables, 1862, and Notre-Dame de Paris, 1831 (known in English as The Hunchback of Notre-Dame).\nThough a committed royalist when he was young, Hugo's views changed as the decades passed, and he became a passionate supporter of republicanism;[citation needed] his work touches upon most of the political and social issues and artistic trends of his time. He was buried in the Panthéon.	\N	\N	\N	http://cdn1.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/images/victor-hugo.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Hugo	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Victor_hugo.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Victor_hugo_gavroche_a_11_ans.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Victur-Hugo-Ave-Paris-Photo-by-Pejman-Akbarzadeh.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Victor_Hugo_bust.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Victor_Hugo_by_Charles_Hugo%2C_c1850-55.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Victor_Hugo_deathbed_portrait_by_Nadar%2C_1885.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Victor_Hugo_mosaic_LOC_photo_meetup_2012.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Stamp_of_USSR_1683.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Victor_Hugo-Bridge.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Tom_Sawyer_1876_frontispiece.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Victor_Hugo-Hunchback.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Victor_Hugo-Exile.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Victor_Hugo-Setting_Sun.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Victor_Hugo-Octopus.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Victor_Hugo_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Victor_Hugo1300.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Victor_Hugo_by_%C3%89tienne_Carjat_1876_-_full.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Open_book_nae_French_flag.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/France_5_Nouveaux_Francs_1959._VF-_Banknote.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Paris-arc_de_triomphe-Victor_Hugo_1885-14.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Panth%C3%A9on_Victor_Hugo.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Books-aj.svg_aj_ashton_01.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Ebcosette.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Bourdon-notre-dame-paris-tour-sud.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e6/Victor_hugo_london_stereoscopic.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Quill_and_ink.svg"]	f	75%
269	Leo Tolstoy	Count Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy (Russian: Лев Никола́евич Толсто́й, pronounced [lʲef nʲɪkɐˈlaɪvʲɪt͡ɕ tɐlˈstoj] ( ); 9 September [O.S. 28 August] 1828 – 20 November [O.S. 7 November] 1910), also known as Leo Tolstoy, was a Russian writer who primarily wrote novels and short stories. Tolstoy was a master of realistic fiction and is widely considered one of the world's greatest novelists. He is best known for two long novels, War and Peace (1869) and Anna Karenina (1877). Tolstoy first achieved literary acclaim in his 20s with his semi-autobiographical trilogy of novels, Childhood, Boyhood, and Youth (1852-1856) and Sevastopol Sketches (1855), based on his experiences in the Crimean War. His fiction output also includes two additional novels, dozens of short stories, and several famous novellas, including The Death of Ivan Ilych, Family Happiness, and Hadji Murad. Later in life, he also wrote plays and essays. Tolstoy is equally known for his complicated and paradoxical persona and for his extreme moralistic and ascetic views, which he adopted after a moral crisis and spiritual awakening in the 1870s, after which he also became noted as a moral thinker and social reformer.\nHis literal interpretation of the ethical teachings of Jesus, centering on the Sermon on the Mount, caused him in later life to become a fervent Christian anarchist and anarcho-pacifist. His ideas on nonviolent resistance, expressed in such works as The Kingdom of God Is Within You, were to have a profound impact on such pivotal twentieth-century figures as Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr., and James Bevel.	\N	\N	\N	http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_B9kO-7TQ__M/TNzXBmOYgjI/AAAAAAAAAWg/VWwIua7sg-M/s1600/Leo%2BTolstoy.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/62/PD-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Ru-Lev_Nikolayevich_Tolstoy.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Wikiversity-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/01/A_coloured_voting_box.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Tolstoy_organising_famine_relief_in_Samara%2C_1891.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/L.N.Tolstoy_Prokudin-Gorsky.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Ilya_Repin_-_Leo_Tolstoy_Barefoot_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Leo_Tolstoy_signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/Leo_Tolstoy-1908.webm", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Gandhi_Tolstoy_Farm.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Tolstoy_Vremya_prishlo.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Graf_Tolstoj_op_Jasnaja_Poljana.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Ge_Sophia_Tolstaya.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Lev_Nikolayevich_Tolstoy_1848.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg"]	f	75%
266	Walter Scott	Sir Walter Scott, 1st Baronet, FRSE (15 August 1771 – 21 September 1832) was a Scottish historical novelist, playwright, and poet.\nScott was the first English-language author to have a truly international career in his lifetime, with many contemporary readers in Europe, Australia, and North America. His novels and poetry are still read, and many of his works remain classics of both English-language literature and of Scottish literature. Famous titles include Ivanhoe, Rob Roy, The Lady of the Lake, Waverley, The Heart of Midlothian and The Bride of Lammermoor.\nAlthough primarily remembered for his extensive literary works and his political engagement, Scott was an advocate, judge and legal administrator by profession, and throughout his career combined his writing and editing work with his daily occupation as Clerk of Session and Sheriff-Depute of Selkirkshire.\nA prominent member of the Tory establishment in Edinburgh, Scott was an active member of the Highland Society and served a long term as President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1820–32).	\N	\N	\N	http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_cyshGWpPjvM/TM_0_1Em-CI/AAAAAAAAAXM/MuAfmBmyw94/s1600/Sir_Walter_Scott_-_Raeburn.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Scott	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Sir_Walter_Scott_-_Raeburn.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Sir_Henry_Raeburn_-_Portrait_of_Sir_Walter_Scott.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/Sir_Walter_Scott_statue_at_Scott_Monument.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Sir_Walter_Scott_Signature.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/The_home_of_Walter_Scott%2C_George_Square%2C_Edinburgh.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Smailholm_Tower_22407_from_E.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Walter_Scott_Legend_of_Montrose_Illustration.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Walter_Scott_-_Project_Gutenberg_eText_18396.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Walter_Scott_statue%2C_Glasgow.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Charles_Robert_Leslie_-_Sir_Walter_Scott_-_Ravenswood_and_Lucy_at_the_Mermaiden%27s_Well_-_Bride_of_Lammermoor.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Rediscovering_the_lost_%27Honours_of_Scotland%27.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Quill_and_ink.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Scott%27s_Minstrelsy_Of_The_Scottish_Border.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Royal_Oak.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Abbotsford04.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Makars%27_Court%2C_Sir_Walter_Scott.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/George_IV_landing_at_Leith.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Scott_Monument_from_St._David_Street.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Scott_Monument%2C_Glasgow.JPG"]	f	75%
298	Nationalism	Nationalism is a belief, creed or political ideology that involves an individual identifying with, or becoming attached to, one's nation. Nationalism involves national identity, by contrast with the related construct of patriotism, which involves the social conditioning and personal behaviors that support a state's decisions and actions.\nFrom a psychological perspective, nationalism (national attachment) is distinct from other types of attachment, for example, attachment to a religion or a romantic partner. The desire for interpersonal attachment, or the need to belong, is one of the most fundamental human motivations.\nFrom a political or sociological perspective, there are two main perspectives on the origins and basis of nationalism. One is the primordialist perspective that describes nationalism as a reflection of the ancient and perceived evolutionary tendency of humans to organize into distinct groupings based on an affinity of birth. The other is the modernist perspective that describes nationalism as a recent phenomenon that requires the structural conditions of modern society in order to exist.\nThere are various definitions for what constitutes a nation, however, which leads to several different strands of nationalism. It can be a belief that citizenship in a state should be limited to one ethnic, cultural, religious, or identity group, or that multinationality in a single state should necessarily comprise the right to express and exercise national identity even by minorities. The adoption of national identity in terms of historical development has commonly been the result of a response by influential groups unsatisfied with traditional identities due to inconsistency between their defined social order and the experience of that social order by its members, resulting in a situation of anomie that nationalists seek to resolve. This anomie results in a society or societies reinterpreting identity, retaining elements that are deemed acceptable and removing elements deemed unacceptable, in order to create a unified community. This development may be the result of internal structural issues or the result of resentment by an existing group or groups towards other communities, especially foreign powers that are or are deemed to be controlling them.\nNational flags, national anthems and other symbols of national identity are commonly considered highly important symbols of the national community.	\N	\N	\N	https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HrzvycheTu4/TXvoJRNxySI/AAAAAAAAAfY/qzKcx17-Ps4/s1600/NationalFlags.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Eug%C3%A8ne_Delacroix_-_La_libert%C3%A9_guidant_le_peuple.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d4/BeaumontScottishUnionFlag.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Missolonghi.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Lipikach.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Paisos_catalans_belfast.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/AmericanFries.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Brasil_ame-o_ou_deixe-o.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Antiimperialismo_caracas.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg"]	f	cover
297	Klemens von Metternich	Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich (full name German: Klemens Wenzel Nepomuk Lothar, Fürst von Metternich-Winneburg zu Beilstein, anglicised as Clement Wenceslas Lothar von Metternich-Winneburg-Beilstein; 15 May 1773 – 11 June 1859) was a politician and statesman of Rhenish extraction and one of the most important diplomats of his era, serving as the Foreign Minister of the Austrian Empire from 1809 until the liberal revolutions of 1848 forced his resignation. One of his first tasks was to engineer a détente with France that included the marriage of Napoleon to the Austrian Arch-Duchess Marie Louise. Soon after, however, he engineered Austria's entry into the War of the Sixth Coalition on the Allied side, signed the Treaty of Fontainebleau that sent Napoleon into exile and led the Austrian delegation at the Congress of Vienna which divided post-Napoleonic Europe between the major powers. In recognition of his service to the Austrian Empire he was raised to the title of Prince in October 1813. Under his guidance, the "Metternich system" of international congresses continued for another decade as Austria aligned herself with Russia and, to a lesser extent, Prussia. This marked the high point of Austria's diplomatic importance, and thereafter Metternich slowly slipped back into the periphery of international diplomacy. At home, Metternich also held the post of Chancellor of State from 1821 until 1848, under both Francis I and his son Ferdinand I. After a brief period of exile in London, Brighton and Brussels that lasted until 1851, he returned once more to the Viennese court, this time to offer only advice to Ferdinand's successor, Franz Josef. Having outlived his generation of politicians, Metternich died at the age of 86 in 1859.\nBorn into the House of Metternich in 1773 as the son of a diplomat, Metternich received a good education at the universities of Strasbourg and Mainz. He also helped during the coronation of Francis II in 1792 and that of his predecessor, Leopold II, in 1790. After a brief trip to England, Metternich was named as the Austrian ambassador to the Netherlands; a short-lived post, since the country was brought under French control the next year. He married his first wife, Eleonore von Kaunitz, in 1795 and it did much to catapult him into Viennese society. Despite having numerous affairs, he was devastated by her death in 1825. He would later remarry, wedding Baroness Antoinette Leykam in 1827 and, after her death in 1829, Countess Melanie Zichy-Ferraris in 1831. She would also predecease him by five years. Before taking office as Foreign Minister, Metternich held numerous smaller posts, including ambassadorial roles in the Kingdom of Saxony, the Kingdom of Prussia and Napoleonic France. One of Metternich's sons, Richard von Metternich, was also a successful diplomat; many of Metternich's twelve other acknowledged children predeceased him. A traditional conservative, Metternich was keen to maintain the balance of power, in particular by resisting Russian territorial ambitions in Central Europe and over the lands of the Ottoman Empire. He disliked liberalism and worked to prevent the breakup of the Austrian empire; for example, by forcibly crushing nationalist revolts in Austrian north Italy and the German states. At home, he pursued a similar policy, using censorship and a wide ranging spy network to dampen down unrest.\nMetternich has both been praised and heavily criticised for the policies he pursued. His supporters point out that he presided over the "Age of Metternich", when international diplomacy helped prevent major wars in Europe. His qualities as a diplomat have also been commended; some add that his achievements were all the better given the weakness of his negotiating position. His decision to oppose Russian imperialism is also seen as a good one. His detractors describe him as a bore who stuck to ill-thought-out conservative principles only out of vanity and a sense of infallibility. They argue that he could have done much more in terms of securing Austria's future; instead, his 1817 proposals for administrative reform were largely rejected and, by opposing German nationalism, they find him responsible for ensuring it would be Prussia and not Austria that united it. Other historians have argued that in fact he had far less power than this view suggests, and that his policies were only accepted when they agreed with the existing view of the Habsburg monarchy that ruled Austria.	\N	\N	\N	http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Uak-oBjaoA0/Ts89WG8_XII/AAAAAAAAAdU/LS9n_VG9DKo/s320/220px-Graf_Clemens_Metternich.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klemens_von_Metternich	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Terra.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/F%C3%BCrst_metternich.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Flag_of_Austria.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Metternich_%28c._1835-40%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Graf_Clemens_Metternich.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Elderly_Metternich.GIF", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Europe_green_light.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Entrevue_Erfurt_by_Nicolas_Grosse.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/01/A_coloured_voting_box.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Prince_Metternich_by_Lawrence.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Napoleon_Marie_Louise_Marriage1.jpeg"]	f	60%
300	Charles Dickens	Charles John Huffam Dickens (/ˈtʃɑrlz ˈdɪkɪnz/; 7 February 1812 – 9 June 1870) was an English writer and social critic. He created some of the world's most memorable fictional characters and is generally regarded as the greatest novelist of the Victorian period. During his life, his works enjoyed unprecedented fame, and by the twentieth century his literary genius was broadly acknowledged by critics and scholars. His novels and short stories continue to be widely popular.\nBorn in Portsmouth, England, Dickens was forced to leave school to work in a factory when his father was thrown into debtors' prison. Although he had little formal education, his early impoverishment drove him to succeed. Over his career he edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five novellas and hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned vigorously for children's rights, education, and other social reforms.\nDickens sprang to fame with the 1836 serial publication of The Pickwick Papers. Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity, famous for his humour, satire, and keen observation of character and society. His novels, most published in monthly or weekly instalments, pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction, which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication. The instalment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience's reaction, and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback. For example, when his wife's chiropodist expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in David Copperfield seemed to reflect her disabilities, Dickens went on to improve the character with positive features. His plots were carefully constructed, and Dickens often wove in elements from topical events into his narratives. Masses of the illiterate poor chipped in ha'pennies to have each new monthly episode read to them, opening up and inspiring a new class of readers.\nDickens was regarded as the literary colossus of his age. His 1843 novella, A Christmas Carol, is one of the most influential works ever written, and it remains popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre. Set in London and Paris, his 1859 novel, A Tale of Two Cities, is the best selling novel of all time. His creative genius has been praised by fellow writers—from Leo Tolstoy to George Orwell and G. K. Chesterton—for its realism, comedy, prose style, unique characterisations, and social criticism. On the other hand Oscar Wilde, Henry James and Virginia Woolf complained of a lack of psychological depth, loose writing, and a vein of saccharine sentimentalism. The term Dickensian is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social conditions or comically repulsive characters.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Charles_Dickens_3.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dickens	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a9/Dickens_may_1852.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4e/Charles_Dickens_s1_1_cd.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Office-book.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Ellen_Ternan.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Francis_Alexander_-_Charles_Dickens_1842.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Little_Dorrit_avatar_1856.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/NSRW_Charles_Dickens.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Dickens_Statue.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Dickens_by_Watkins_detail.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Dickens_dream.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Dickensposter_nottingham1869.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Charles_Dickens_by_Daniel_Maclise.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/Charles_Dickens_by_Ary_Scheffer_1855.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Charles_Dickens_circa_1860.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Charles_Dickens_by_Watkins_c1860s.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Charlesdickens.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Charles_Dickens_circa_1860s.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/David_Copperfield%2C_We_are_disturbed_in_our_cookery.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/ChathamOrdnanceTerrCrop.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Dickens_Gurney_head.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Dickens-at-the-Blacking-Warehouse.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b6/Second_Marshalsea_prison_in_the_19th_or_20th_century.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Staplehurst_rail_crash.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Samuel_Luke_Fildes_-_The_Empty_Chair_%28The_Graphic%2C_1870%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Charles_Dickens2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Charles_Dickens%2C_public_reading%2C_1867.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Charles_Dickens_1850.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Charles_Dickens_-_Project_Gutenberg_eText_13103.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Bleak-house-broadstairs.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/CharlesDickens_house_Portsmouth.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Catherine_Dickens.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a5/Dickens_by_Brian_Whelan_2012.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Charles_Dickens_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Charles_Dickens_3.jpg"]	f	contain
395	Nazi Germany	Nazi Germany and the Third Reich are common names for Germany during the period from 1933 to 1945, when its government was controlled by Adolf Hitler and his National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP), commonly known as the Nazi Party. Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist totalitarian state which controlled nearly all aspects of life. Nazi Germany ceased to exist after the Allied Forces defeated Germany in May 1945, thus ending World War II in Europe.\nAfter Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany by the President of the Weimar Republic Paul von Hindenburg on 30 January 1933, the Nazi Party began to eliminate all political opposition and consolidate their power. Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934, and Hitler became dictator of Germany when the powers and offices of the Chancellery and Presidency were merged. A national referendum held 19 August 1934 confirmed Hitler as sole Führer (leader) of Germany. All power was centralised in Hitler's hands, and his word was above all laws. The government was not a coordinated, co-operating body, but rather a collection of factions struggling to amass power and gain Hitler's favour. In the midst of the Great Depression, the Nazis restored economic stability and ended mass unemployment using heavy military spending and a mixed economy. Extensive public works were undertaken, including the construction of Autobahns (high speed highways). The return to economic stability boosted the regime's popularity.\nRacism, especially antisemitism, was a central feature of the regime. The Germanic peoples—also referred to as the Nordic race—were considered to be the purest representation of Aryanism, and therefore the master race. Jews and others deemed undesirable were persecuted or murdered, and opposition to Hitler's rule was ruthlessly suppressed. Members of the liberal, socialist, and communist opposition were killed, imprisoned, or forced into exile. The Christian churches were also oppressed, with many leaders imprisoned. Education focused on racial biology, population policy, and fitness for military service. Career and educational opportunities for women were curtailed. Recreation and tourism were organised via the Strength Through Joy program, and the 1936 Summer Olympics showcased the Third Reich on the international stage. Propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels made effective use of film, mass rallies, and Hitler's hypnotising oratory to control public opinion. The government controlled artistic expression, promoting specific art forms and discouraging or banning others.\nNazi Germany made increasingly aggressive territorial demands, threatening war if they were not met. Austria and Czechoslovakia were seized in 1938 and 1939. Hitler made a pact with Joseph Stalin and invaded Poland in September 1939, launching World War II in Europe. In alliance with Italy and other Axis powers, Germany conquered most of Europe by 1940 and threatened Great Britain. Reichskommissariats took brutal control of conquered areas, and a German administration was established in Poland. Jews and others deemed undesirable were imprisoned and murdered in Nazi concentration camps and extermination camps. The implementation of the regime's racial policies culminated in the mass murder of Jews and other minorities in the Holocaust. Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, the tide turned against the Third Reich, and major military defeats were suffered in 1943. Large-scale bombing of German cities, rail lines, and oil plants escalated in 1944. Germany was overrun in 1945 by the Soviets from the east and the other Allies from the west. Hitler's refusal to admit defeat led to massive destruction of German infrastructure and unnecessary loss of life in the closing months of the war. The victorious Allies initiated a policy of denazification and put the surviving Nazi leadership on trial for war crimes at the Nuremberg Trials.	\N	\N	\N	http://www.unmuseum.org/hitlerwins.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7d/Adolf_Hitler_cph_3a48970.jpg",

309	Friedrich Engels	Friedrich Engels (German: [ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈɛŋəls]; 28 November 1820 – 5 August 1895) was a German social scientist, author, political theorist, philosopher, and father of Marxist theory, alongside Karl Marx. In 1845 he published The Condition of the Working Class in England, based on personal observations and research. In 1848 he co-authored The Communist Manifesto with Karl Marx, and later he supported Marx financially to do research and write Das Kapital. After Marx's death, Engels edited the second and third volumes. Additionally, Engels organized Marx's notes on the "Theories of Surplus Value" and this was later published as the "fourth volume" of Capital. He has also made important contributions to family economics.	\N	\N	\N	http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YMMEjtQqCUE/UKbpmspdVBI/AAAAAAAAACQ/teCy96Ya0w0/s300/Friedrich-Engels-2.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Engels	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Symbol-hammer-and-sickle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Socrates.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Friedrich_Engels_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Engels_1856.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Marx_and_Engels.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Hammer_and_Sickle_Red_Star_with_Glow.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/280505_001_Engelshaus_Barmen.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Engels.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Engel_House_in_Primrose.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Red_flag_II.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg"]	f	60%

323	Otto von Bismarck	Otto Eduard Leopold, Prince of Bismarck, Duke of Lauenburg (1 April 1815 – 30 July 1898), known as Otto von Bismarck, was a conservative Prussian statesman who dominated German and European affairs from the 1860s until 1890. In the 1860s he engineered a series of short, decisive wars, that unified most of the German states (excluding Austria) into a powerful German Empire under Prussian leadership. With that accomplished by 1871 he then skillfully used balance of power diplomacy to preserve Germany's new role and keep Europe at peace.\nUpon his appointment by King Wilhelm I as Minister President of Prussia (1862–90), Bismarck provoked wars that made Prussia dominant over Austria and France, and aligned the smaller German states behind Prussia. In 1867, he also became Chancellor of the North German Confederation. Otto von Bismarck became the first Chancellor of a united Germany after the 1871 Treaty of Versailles and largely controlled its affairs until he was removed by Emperor Wilhelm II in 1890. His diplomacy of realpolitik and powerful rule gained him the nickname the "Iron Chancellor".\nHe used diplomacy to keep the balance of power in Europe in the 1870s and 1880s. He created a new nation-state and led the way to the welfare state. He disliked colonialism but reluctantly built an overseas empire when it was demanded by both elite and mass opinion. A devout Lutheran, he was loyal to his king, who in turn gave Bismarck his full support. While his new German Empire had universal male suffrage, the elected officials did not have real control of the government. Bismarck distrusted democracy and ruled through a strong, well-trained bureaucracy with power in the hands of a Junker elite that represented the landed aristocracy of the east.\nBismarck, an aristocratic Junker himself, had an extremely aggressive and domineering personality. He possessed not only a long-term national and international vision, but also the short-term ability to juggle many complex developments simultaneously. As the leader of what historians call "revolutionary conservatism" Bismarck became a hero to German nationalists; they built hundreds of monuments glorifying the iconic symbol of powerful conservative leadership. Historians generally praise him as a statesman of moderation and balance who kept the peace in Europe and was primarily responsible for the unification of modern Germany.	\N	\N	\N	http://www.theglobaldispatches.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Otto-Von-Bismarck2.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_von_Bismarck	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Otto_von_Bismarck.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Rudelsburg_Junger_Bismarck_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Otto_F%C3%BCrst_von_Bismarck.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Otto_vBismark.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Otto_vonBismarck_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Otto_von_Bismarck%2C_Jugendbildnis_im_Alter_von_22_Jahren.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Hamburg-Bismarck-Denkmal.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Httpdigi.ub.uni-heidelberg.dediglitklabismarck18900050a.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Lutherrose.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/Otto%2Bvon%2Bbismarck.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/DodgerBlue_flag_waving.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-R29818%2C_Otto_von_Bismarck.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Flag_of_Germany_%283-2_aspect_ratio%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/Flag_of_German_Reich_%281933%E2%80%931935%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Flag_of_the_German_Empire.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Flag_of_Prussia_1892-1918.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Franz_von_Lenbach_-_Portrait_of_Otto_Eduard_Leopold_von_Bismarck_-_Walters_371007_-_View_B.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Flag_of_the_NSDAP_%281920%E2%80%931945%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Franz_von_Lenbach_Bismarck.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/World_war_one_web_alliance.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Wernerprokla.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Wappen_Deutsches_Reich_-_K%C3%B6nigreich_Preussen_%28Mittleres%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Bismarck80Jahre.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Bismarck-Wappen.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/BismarckRoonMoltke.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/BismarckLandtag.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/1889_recording_by_Otto_von_Bismarck.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Bismarck-Nationaldenkmal%2C_M%C3%A4rz_2008.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/1890_Bismarcks_Ruecktritt.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/01/A_coloured_voting_box.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Bundesarchiv_Bild_146-1990-023-06A%2C_Otto_von_Bismarck.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Bismarcks_Wappen_.gif"]	f	cover
318	Simón Bolívar	Simón José Antonio de la Santísima Trinidad Bolívar y Palacios Ponte y Blanco (24 July 1783 – 17 December 1830), commonly known as Simón Bolívar (Spanish pronunciation: [siˈmon boˈliβar]), was a military and political leader. Bolívar played a key role in Latin America's successful struggle for independence from the Spanish Empire, and is today considered one of the most influential politicians in the history of the Americas.\nFollowing the triumph over the Spanish monarchy, Bolívar participated in the foundation of the first union of independent nations in Hispanic-America, a republic, now known as Gran Colombia, of which he was president from 1819 to 1830. Bolívar is regarded as a hero, visionary, revolutionary, and liberator in Hispanic-America.\nDuring his lifetime, he led Venezuela, Colombia (including Panama at the time), Ecuador, Peru (together with Don José de San Martín), and Bolivia to independence from the Spanish Empire. Admirers claim that he helped lay the foundations for democracy in much of Latin America.	\N	\N	\N	http://www.bolivarwv.org/Images/simonbolivar1.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim%C3%B3n_Bol%C3%ADvar	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Sim%C3%B3n_Bol%C3%ADvar_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Sim%C3%B3n_Bol%C3%ADvar%2C_1816.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Sim%C3%B3n_Bol%C3%ADvar_-_Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Espinosa%2C_1830.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Sim%C3%B3n_Bol%C3%ADvar_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Casa_natal_del_Libertador.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Flag_of_Venezuela.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Flag_of_Bolivia_%28state%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Gran_Sello_de_la_Rep%C3%BAblica_del_Per%C3%BA.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Flag_of_the_President_of_Colombia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/La_Muerte_del_Libertador_-_Antonio_Herrera_Toro.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Juan_Vicente_Bol%C3%ADvar.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Presidential_Standard_of_Venezuela.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Manuela_S%C3%A1ens_Thorne.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Sim%C3%B3n_Bol%C3%ADvar%2C_1800.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Red_versus_blue_swords.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Batalla_de_Jun%C3%ADn.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/Batalla_de_Carabobo.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Bolivarmemorial01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Bolivar_Paris.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/8_Soles_%C3%A0_l%27effigie_de_Simon_Bolivar%2C1834%2CPotosi.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Ambox_question.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/A_Monument_of_Simon_Bolivar_in_Sofia%2C_Bulgaria.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/EstatuaDelLibertadorEnLaPlazaBolivar2004-6.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Congreso_de_C%C3%BAcuta.jpg"]	f	50%
327	Manifest destiny	In the 19th century, Manifest Destiny was the widely held belief in the United States that American settlers were destined to expand throughout the continent. Historians have for the most part agreed that there are three basic themes to Manifest Destiny:\nThe special virtues of the American people and their institutions;\nAmerica's mission to redeem and remake the west in the image of agrarian America;\nAn irresistible destiny to accomplish this essential duty.\nHistorian Frederick Merk says this concept was born out of "A sense of mission to redeem the Old World by high example [...] generated by the potentialities of a new earth for building a new heaven".\nHistorians have emphasized that "Manifest Destiny" was a contested concept—many prominent Americans (such as Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, and most Whigs) rejected it. Historian Daniel Walker Howe writes, "American imperialism did not represent an American consensus; it provoked bitter dissent within the national polity.... Whigs saw America's moral mission as one of democratic example rather than one of conquest."\nManifest Destiny provided the rhetorical tone for the largest acquisition of U.S. territory. It was used by Democrats in the 1840s to justify the war with Mexico and it was also used to divide half of Oregon with Great Britain. But Manifest Destiny always limped along because of its internal limitations and the issue of slavery, says Merk. It never became a national priority. By 1843 John Quincy Adams, originally a major supporter, had changed his mind and repudiated Manifest Destiny because it meant the expansion of slavery in Texas.\nMerk concludes:\nFrom the outset Manifest Destiny—vast in program, in its sense of continentalism—was slight in support. It lacked national, sectional, or party following commensurate with its magnitude. The reason was it did not reflect the national spirit. The thesis that it embodied nationalism, found in much historical writing, is backed by little real supporting evidence.	\N	\N	\N	http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sEin5TzpDZE/UB860HXAywI/AAAAAAAAAIU/tPWgz9kE0yI/s1600/American_progress.JPG	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_destiny	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/UnitedStatesExpansion.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/John_Quincy_Adams.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/WilliamWalker.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/American_progress.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/John_O%27Sullivan.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Emanuel_Leutze_-_Westward_the_Course_of_Empire_Takes_Its_Way_-_Smithsonian.jpg"]	f	cover
330	Henry Wadsworth Longfellow	Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (February 27, 1807 – March 24, 1882) was an American poet and educator whose works include "Paul Revere's Ride", The Song of Hiawatha, and Evangeline. He was also the first American to translate Dante Alighieri's The Divine Comedy and was one of the five Fireside Poets.\nLongfellow was born in Portland, Maine, which was then a part of Massachusetts. He studied at Bowdoin College. After spending time in Europe he became a professor at Bowdoin and, later, at Harvard College. His first major poetry collections were Voices of the Night (1839) and Ballads and Other Poems (1841). Longfellow retired from teaching in 1854 to focus on his writing, living the remainder of his life in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in a former headquarters of George Washington. His first wife Mary Potter died in 1835 after a miscarriage. His second wife Frances Appleton died in 1861 after sustaining burns when her dress caught fire. After her death, Longfellow had difficulty writing poetry for a time and focused on his translation. He died in 1882.\nLongfellow wrote predominantly lyric poems, known for their musicality and often presenting stories of mythology and legend. He became the most popular American poet of his day and also had success overseas. He has been criticized, however, for imitating European styles and writing specifically for the masses.	\N	\N	\N	http://cdn1.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/images/henry-wadsworth-longfellow-1.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Wadsworth_Longfellow	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Mary_Storer_Potter.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Longfellow_Village_Blacksmith_%28manuscript_1%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Sumner-Longfellow.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Henry_Wadsworth_Longfellow_1940_Issue-1c.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Henry_Wadsworth_Longfellow%2C_photographed_by_Julia_Margaret_Cameron_in_1868.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Henry_Wadsworth_Longfellow_by_Southworth_%26_Hawes_c1850_restored.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Henry_Wadsworth_Longfellow_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/FA_Longfellow_and_sons_c1849.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Henry_W_Longfellow_with_signature-crop.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Fanny_Appleton_Longfellow_Drawing.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Longfellow-Grave2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Longfellow%27s_Birthplace%2C_Portland%2C_ME.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg"]	f	70%
336	Henry David Thoreau	Henry David Thoreau (/θəˈroʊ, ˈθɔroʊ, ˈθoʊroʊ/; July 12, 1817 – May 6, 1862) was an American author, poet, philosopher, abolitionist, naturalist, tax resister, development critic, surveyor, historian, and leading transcendentalist. He is best known for his book Walden, a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay Resistance to Civil Government (also known as Civil Disobedience), an argument for disobedience to an unjust state.\nThoreau's books, articles, essays, journals, and poetry total over 20 volumes. Among his lasting contributions are his writings on natural history and philosophy, where he anticipated the methods and findings of ecology and environmental history, two sources of modern-day environmentalism. His literary style interweaves close natural observation, personal experience, pointed rhetoric, symbolic meanings, and historical lore, while displaying a poetic sensibility, philosophical austerity, and "Yankee" love of practical detail. He was also deeply interested in the idea of survival in the face of hostile elements, historical change, and natural decay; at the same time he advocated abandoning waste and illusion in order to discover life's true essential needs.\nHe was a lifelong abolitionist, delivering lectures that attacked the Fugitive Slave Law while praising the writings of Wendell Phillips and defending abolitionist John Brown. Thoreau's philosophy of civil disobedience later influenced the political thoughts and actions of such notable figures as Leo Tolstoy, Mohandas Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, Jr.\nThoreau is sometimes cited as an anarchist. Though Civil Disobedience seems to call for improving rather than abolishing government — "I ask for, not at once no government, but at once a better government" — the direction of this improvement points toward anarchism: "'That government is best which governs not at all;' and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have." Richard Drinnon partly blames Thoreau for the ambiguity, noting that Thoreau's "sly satire, his liking for wide margins for his writing, and his fondness for paradox provided ammunition for widely divergent interpretations of 'Civil Disobedience.'"\n\n	\N	\N	\N	http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/06/f7/e2/walden-in-autumn.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_David_Thoreau	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Wheeler-Minot_Farmhouse%2C_Concord_MA.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Wikiversity-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Thoreaus_quote_near_his_cabin_site%2C_Walden_Pond.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/VII._Rowse.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Walden_Pond%2C_2010.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Walden_Thoreau.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/John_Brown_-_Treason_broadside%2C_1859.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Henry_David_Thoreau_quote_-_Library_Way_-_NY_City.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/P_derecho.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Nobska_Lighthouse_1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Replica_of_Thoreau%27s_cabin_near_Walden_Pond_and_his_statue.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Quill_and_ink.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Thoreau1967stamp.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Thoreau%27s_cabin_inside.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Thoreau_sites_in_Walden_Pond.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/ThoreauBust.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Eggs_BSNH_1930.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Bhagavata_Gita_Bishnupur_Arnab_Dutta_2011.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Grave_of_Henry_David_Thoreau.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/EndlessKnot03d.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Aegopodium_podagraria1_ies.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Benjamin_D._Maxham_-_Henry_David_Thoreau_-_Restored.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Appletons%27_Thoreau_Henry_David_signature.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/01/A_coloured_voting_box.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Henry_David_Thoreau_-_Dunshee_ambrotpe_1861.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Henry_David_Thoreau.jpg"]	f	cover
444	Jean-Paul Sartre	Jean-Paul Charles Aymard Sartre (/ˈsɑrtrə/; French: [saʁtʁ]; 21 June 1905 – 15 April 1980) was a French philosopher, playwright, novelist, screenwriter, political activist, biographer, and literary critic. He was one of the key figures in the philosophy of existentialism and phenomenology, and one of the leading figures in 20th-century French philosophy and Marxism.\nHis work has also influenced sociology, critical theory, post-colonial theory, and literary studies, and continues to influence these disciplines. Sartre has also been noted for his open relationship with the prominent feminist theorist Simone de Beauvoir.\nHe was awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize in Literature but refused it, saying that he always declined official honors and that "a writer should not allow himself to be turned into an institution".	\N	\N	\N	http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2008/02/11/timestopics/topics_sartre_395.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Sartre	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Wikidata-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Jean_Paul_Sartre_by_Gray.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Jean_Paul_Sartre_1967.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/People_icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Le_G%C3%A9n%C3%A9ral_George_C._Marshall_de_visite_de_journalistes.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/2010.05.30.113308_Haus_H%C3%A9l%C3%A8ne_de_Beauvoir_Goxwiller_FR.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Jean-Paul_Sartre_FP.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Beauvoir_Sartre_-_Che_Guevara_-1960_-_Cuba.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ed/Nobel_Prize.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Sartre_and_de_Beauvoir_at_Balzac_Memorial.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Sartre_and_Simone_de_Beauvoir_grave%2C_Montparnasse%2C_Paris%2C_France-16June2009.jpg"]	f	cover
365	Pointillism	Pointillism /ˈpɔɪntɨlɪzəm/ is a technique of painting in which small, distinct dots of pure color are applied in patterns to form an image. Georges Seurat and Paul Signac developed the technique in 1886, branching from Impressionism. The term Pointillism was first coined by art critics in the late 1880s to ridicule the works of these artists, and is now used without its earlier mocking connotation. Neo-impressionism and Divisionism are also terms used to describe this technique of painting called pointillism.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointillism	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Seurat-La_Parade_detail.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Paul_Signac_Femmes_au_puits_1892d%C3%A9tailcouleur.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/VanGogh_1887_Selbstbildnis.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Camille_Pissarro_-_The_Church_at_Eragny_-_Walters_372653.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Morning%2C_Interior_-_Luce.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Lemmen2.jpg"]	f	cover
366	Post-Impressionism	Post-Impressionism (also spelled Postimpressionism) is the term coined by the British artist and art critic Roger Fry in 1910 to describe the development of French art since Manet.

Post-Impressionists extended Impressionism while rejecting its limitations: they continued using vivid colours, often thick application of paint, and real-life subject matter, but they were more inclined to emphasize geometric forms, to distort form for expressive effect, and to use unnatural or arbitrary colour.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Impressionism	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1a/Bonnard-the_dining_room_in_the_country.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Vincent_Willem_van_Gogh_132.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/%C3%89douard_Vuillard_001.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/%C3%89mile_Bernard_1888-08_-_Breton_Women_in_the_Meadow_%28Le_Pardon_de_Pont-Aven%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Serusier_-_the_talisman.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Signac_-_Portrait_de_F%C3%A9lix_F%C3%A9n%C3%A9on.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Valloton_Frau_mit_Dienstmagd_beim_Baden.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Lautrecx07.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Henri_de_Toulouse-Lautrec_036.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Maximilien_Luce_-_%27Montmartre%2C_de_la_rue_Cortot%2C_vue_vers_saint-denis%27%2C_oil_on_canvas_painting%2C_c._1900.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Lemmen2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_082.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Paesaggio_nabi_paul_ranson.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Portrait-Alice-Sethe-1888.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Paul_Gauguin_128.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Schutzenberger_Iles_du_Rhin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Robert_Antoine_Pinchon%2C_Le_Pont_aux_Anglais%2C_soleil_couchant%2C_1905%2C_oil_on_canvas%2C_54_x_73_cm%2C_Mus%C3%A9e_des_Beaux-Arts_de_Rouen.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Claude_Monet%2C_Impression%2C_soleil_levant%2C_1872.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Charles_Th%C3%A9ophile_Angrand_001.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Henri_Edmond_Cross_001.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Georges_Seurat_-_Un_dimanche_apr%C3%A8s-midi_%C3%A0_l%27%C3%8Ele_de_la_Grande_Jatte.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/1914_Redon_Zyklop_anagoria.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Camille_Pissarro_016.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Affiche_Volpini.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Henri_Rousseau_007.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Henri_Rousseau_-_Self-portrait_of_the_Artist_with_a_Lamp.jpg"]	f	cover
341	American Civil War	The American Civil War, also known as the War Between the States, or simply the Civil War in the United States (see naming), was a civil war fought from 1861 to 1865 in the United States of America after seven Southern slave states declared their secession and formed the Confederate States of America (the "Confederacy" or the "South"). The states that remained in the Union were known as the "Union" or the "North". The war had its origin in the fractious issue of slavery, especially the extension of slavery into the western territories. Foreign powers did not intervene. After four years of bloody combat that left over 600,000 soldiers dead and destroyed much of the South's infrastructure, the Confederacy collapsed, slavery was abolished, and the difficult Reconstruction process of restoring national unity and guaranteeing rights to the freed slaves began.\nIn the 1860 presidential election, Republicans, led by Abraham Lincoln, opposed the expansion of slavery into United States' territories. Lincoln won, but before his inauguration on March 4, 1861, seven slave states with cotton-based economies formed the Confederacy. Outgoing Democratic President James Buchanan and the incoming Republicans rejected secession as illegal. Lincoln's inaugural address declared his administration would not initiate civil war. Eight remaining slave states continued to reject calls for secession. Confederate forces seized numerous federal forts within territory claimed by the Confederacy. A peace conference failed to find a compromise, and both sides prepared for war. The Confederates assumed that European countries were so dependent on "King Cotton" that they would intervene; none did and none recognized the new Confederate States of America.\nHostilities began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate forces fired upon Fort Sumter, a key fort held by Union troops in South Carolina. Lincoln called for each state to provide troops to retake the fort; consequently, four more slave states joined the Confederacy, bringing their total to eleven. The Union soon controlled the border states and established a naval blockade that crippled the southern economy. The Eastern Theater was inconclusive in 1861–62. The autumn 1862 Confederate campaign into Maryland (a Union state) ended with Confederate retreat at the Battle of Antietam, dissuading British intervention. Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which made ending slavery a war goal. To the west, by summer 1862 the Union destroyed the Confederate river navy, then much of their western armies, and the Union siege of Vicksburg split the Confederacy in two at the Mississippi River. In 1863, Robert E. Lee's Confederate incursion north ended at the Battle of Gettysburg. Western successes led to Ulysses S. Grant's command of all Union armies in 1864. In the Western Theater, William T. Sherman drove east to capture Atlanta and marched to the sea, destroying Confederate infrastructure along the way. The Union marshaled the resources and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all directions, and could afford to fight battles of attrition through the Overland Campaign towards Richmond, the Confederate capital. The defending Confederate army failed, leading to Lee's surrender to Grant at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865. All Confederate generals surrendered by that summer.\nThe American Civil War was one of the earliest true industrial wars. Railroads, the telegraph, steamships, and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively. The mobilization of civilian factories, mines, shipyards, banks, transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed World War I. It remains the deadliest war in American history, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 750,000 soldiers and an undetermined number of civilian casualties. Historian John Huddleston estimates the death toll at ten percent of all Northern males 20–45 years old, and 30 percent of all Southern white males aged 18–40.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Marais-massacre.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Union_soldiers_entrenched_along_the_west_bank_of_the_Rappahannock_River_at_Fredericksburg%2C_Virginia_%28111-B-157%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/US_flag_35_stars.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Wikipedia-logo-v2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Wilson%27s_Creek_charge_of_1st_Iowa.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/New_Orleans_h76369k.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/80/Wikipedia-logo-v2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Marais-massacre.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/NYRiot.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/NavalBattleOfFortPillow.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/NewOrleans1841AcrossRiver.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Freedmen_richmond_sewing_women.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/Grand_Army_of_the_Republic_by_Swatjester.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Great_Meeting_Union_Square.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/John_J._Crittenden_-_Brady-Handy.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Conf_dead_chancellorsville_edit1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/CSA_FLAG_28.11.1861-1.5.1863.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Bonnieblue.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Chickamauga.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Cherokee_Confederates_Reunion.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Civil_war_1861-1865.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Civil_War_centennial_issues.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Contrabands_at_Headquarters_of_General_Lafayette_by_Mathew_Brady.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Cold_Harbor%2C_Va._African_Americans_collecting_bones.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/First_Charleston_Harbor.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/EwellsDeadSpotsylvania1864crop01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Cicatrices_de_flagellation_sur_un_esclave.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/US_Secession_map_1863_%28BlankMap_derived%29.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/US_Secession_map_1861.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/USS_Wissahickon_Crewmembers.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/The_Peacemakers_1868.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Stephen_Arnold_Douglas.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Steamship_Star_of_the_West%2C_with_reinforcements_for_Major_Anderson%2C_approaching_Fort_Sumter.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Soldiers_White_Black_1861.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Scott-anaconda.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/President-Jefferson-Davis.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/People_icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/American_Civil_War_Montage.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Alfred_A._Stratton.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Battle_of_Antietam_by_Thulstrup.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/AndersonvilleCemetary.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/A_Race_Meeting_at_Jacksonville%2C_Alabama_by_W.S._Hedges_-_BMA.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Wikinews-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Acw_bs_7a.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Abraham_Lincoln_seated%2C_Feb_9%2C_1864.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Battle_of_Lawrence.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Battle_of_Hampton_Roads_3g01752u.jpg"]	f	cover
367	Paul Cézanne	Paul Cézanne (US /seɪˈzæn/ or UK /sɨˈzæn/; French: [pɔl sezan]; 1839–1906) was a French artist and Post-Impressionist painter whose work laid the foundations of the transition from the 19th-century conception of artistic endeavour to a new and radically different world of art in the 20th century. Cézanne's often repetitive, exploratory brushstrokes are highly characteristic and clearly recognizable. He used planes of colour and small brushstrokes that build up to form complex fields. The paintings convey Cézanne's intense study of his subjects.\nCézanne can be said to form the bridge between late 19th-century Impressionism and the early 20th century's new line of artistic enquiry, Cubism. Both Matisse and Picasso are said to have remarked that Cézanne "is the father of us all."	\N	\N	\N	http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-s9qOBeuHBbU/UAWfK3K_hZI/AAAAAAAAAcQ/49SsGkkOlKo/s1600/cezanne-peasant-large.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_047.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_185.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Paul_cezanne_1861.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_169.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_210.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_Madame_C%C3%A9zanne.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne%2C_Pyramid_of_Skulls%2C_c._1901.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_125.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_127.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_100.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_107.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_115.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_117.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_083.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_086.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_088.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_090.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/27/Woman_in_a_Green_Hat_%28by_Paul_C%C3%A9zanne%2C_1894-95%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_193.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_014.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_-_Paul_Alexis_L%C3%AA_um_Manuscrito_a_Zola.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_033.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_026.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_048.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_044.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_060.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_052.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_079.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_063.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_157.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_156.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_154.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_151.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_149.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_143.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_141.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_137.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_133.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_130.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Jas_de_bouffan.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/C%C3%A9zanne%2C_Paul_-_Still_Life_with_a_Curtain.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/Paul_Cezanne%2C_A_Modern_Olympia%2C_c._1873-1874.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Overture.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Ballerina-icon.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_195.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Claude_Monet%2C_Impression%2C_soleil_levant%2C_1872.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Cezanne_-_Madame_Cezanne_in_Rot.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne%2C_1892-95%2C_Les_joueurs_de_carte_%28The_Card_Players%29%2C_60_x_73_cm%2C_oil_on_canvas%2C_Courtauld_Institute_of_Art%2C_London.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne%2C_1888-90%2C_Madame_C%C3%A9zanne_%28Hortense_Fiquet%2C_1850%E2%80%931922%29_in_a_Red_Dress%2C_oil_on_canvas%2C_116.5_x_89.5_cm%2C_The_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art%2C_New_York.jpg"]	f	cover
348	Intelligent design	Intelligent design (ID) is a form of creationism, the belief that "certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection," presented by its proponents with the claim that this is a scientific theory. It is a version of the theological argument from design for the existence of God presented as "an evidence-based scientific theory about life's origins" rather than "a religious-based idea."\nThe leading proponents of this version of the argument are associated with the Discovery Institute, a politically conservative think tank based in the United States, and believe the designer to be the Christian deity. Their concepts of irreducible complexity and specified complexity propose that certain biological features are too complex to be the result of natural processes, and proponents therefore conclude that these features are evidence of design. The scientific community considers intelligent design a pseudoscience because it lacks empirical support and offers no tenable hypotheses. Detailed scientific examination has rebutted the claims that evolutionary explanations are inadequate, and this premise of intelligent design, that evidence against evolution constitutes evidence for design, has been criticized as a false dichotomy. From the outset, ID proponents have sought to overturn the methodological naturalism inherent in modern science, proposing that it be replaced by "theistic realism" or "theistic science" in which ID presents a broadly theistic understanding of nature.\nThe intelligent design movement (IDM) was developed by a group of American creationists who revised their argument in the creation–evolution controversy to circumvent court rulings such as the 1987 United States Supreme Court's Edwards v. Aguillard decision, which barred the teaching of creation science in public schools on the grounds of breaching the separation of church and state. The first publication of the phrase intelligent design, in its present use as an alternative term for creationism, occurred in Of Pandas and People, a 1989 textbook intended for high school biology classes. From the mid-1990s, intelligent design proponents were supported by the Discovery Institute, which, together with its Center for Science and Culture (CSC), planned and funded the "intelligent design movement." They advocated inclusion of intelligent design in public school biology curricula, leading to the 2005 Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial, where U.S. District Judge John E. Jones III ruled that intelligent design is not science, that it "cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents," and that the school district's promotion of it therefore violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_design	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/aa/Pandas_and_ppl.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Michelangelo%2C_Creation_of_Adam_04.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/MichaelBehe.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/Pandas_text_analysis.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Office-book.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/BwcOmega911a.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Dembski_head_shot.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/Creaci%C3%B3n_de_Ad%C3%A1m.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg"]	f	cover
356	Synchronicity	Synchronicity is the experience of two or more events as meaningfully related, where they are unlikely to be causally related. The subject sees it as a meaningful coincidence. The concept of synchronicity was first described by Carl Jung, a Swiss psychologist, in the 1920s.\nThe concept does not question, or compete with, the notion of causality. Instead, it maintains that just as events may be connected by a causal line, they may also be connected by meaning. A grouping of events by meaning need not have an explanation in terms of a concrete sense of cause and effect.\nIn addition to Jung, Arthur Koestler wrote extensively on synchronicity in The Roots of Coincidence.\n\n	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Sch%C3%A9ma_synchronicit%C3%A9_in_English.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg"]	f	cover
48	Society of Jesus	The Society of Jesus (Latin: Societas Iesu, S.J., SJ or SI) is a Christian male religious congregation of the Catholic Church. The members are called Jesuits. The society is engaged in evangelization and apostolic ministry in 112 nations on six continents. Jesuits work in education (founding schools, colleges, universities and seminaries), intellectual research, and cultural pursuits. Jesuits also give retreats, minister in hospitals and parishes and promote social justice and ecumenical dialogue.\nIgnatius of Loyola founded the society after being wounded in battle and experiencing a religious conversion. He composed the Spiritual Exercises to help others follow the teachings of Jesus Christ. In 1534, Ignatius and six other young men, including Francis Xavier and Peter Faber, gathered and professed vows of poverty, chastity, and later obedience, including a special vow of obedience to the Pope. Rule 13 of Ignatius's Rules for Thinking with the Church said: "That we may be altogether of the same mind and in conformity ... if [the Church] shall have defined anything to be black which to our eyes appears to be white, we ought in like manner to pronounce it to be black." Ignatius's plan of the order's organization was approved by Pope Paul III in 1540 by the bull containing the "Formula of the Institute".\nBecause of the military background of Ignatius and the members' willingness to accept orders anywhere in the world and to live in extreme conditions where required, the opening lines of this founding document would declare that the Society of Jesus was founded for "whoever desires to serve as a soldier of God" (Spanish: "todo el que quiera militar para Dios"), "to strive especially for the defense and propagation of the faith and for the progress of souls in Christian life and doctrine." Therefore Jesuits are sometimes referred to colloquially as "God's Soldiers" or "God's Marines". The Society participated in the Counter-Reformation and later in the implementation of the Second Vatican Council in the Catholic Church.\nThe Society of Jesus is consecrated under the patronage of Madonna Della Strada, a title of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and it is led by a Superior General, currently Adolfo Nicolás.\nThe headquarters of the society, its General Curia, is in Rome. The historic curia of St. Ignatius is now part of the Collegio del Gesù attached to the Church of the Gesù, the Jesuit Mother Church.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Ihs-logo.svg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Jesus	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/LifeAndWorksOfConfucius1687.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Regimini_militantis_Ecclesiae.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Ricci_Guangqi_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/StPierreParis.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Visita_do_Papa_PUG_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/JHS-IHS-Monogram-Name-Jesus.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Ihs-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Jesuites_en_chine.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Jesuit_ruins_at_trinidad.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Jesuits_in_the_%27Ibadat-Khanah%27.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Jesuitpainting.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/North_American_Martyrs.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Kruis_san_damiano.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Ratiostudiorum.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/P_christianity.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Coat_of_arms_Holy_See.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Coat_of_arms_Holy_See.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Father_marquette_preaching.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/Emblem_of_the_Papacy_SE.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/046CupolaSPietro.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Basilica_of_St._Ignatius_in_Loyola.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/BCburnslawnsunset.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Ignatius_Loyola.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Georgetown_Riverview.jpg"]	f	cover
362	Pierre-Auguste Renoir	Pierre-Auguste Renoir (US /rɛnˈwɑr/ or UK /ˈrɛnwɑr/; French: [pjɛʁ oɡyst ʁənwaʁ]; 25 February 1841 – 3 December 1919) was a French artist who was a leading painter in the development of the Impressionist style. As a celebrator of beauty, and especially feminine sensuality, it has been said that "Renoir is the final representative of a tradition which runs directly from Rubens to Watteau."\nPierre-Auguste was the father of actor Pierre Renoir (1885–1952), filmmaker Jean Renoir (1894–1979) and ceramic artist Claude Renoir (1901–69). He was the grandfather of the filmmaker Claude Renoir (1913–1993), son of Pierre.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Pierre-Auguste_Renoir_-_Autoportrait%2C_1875.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Auguste_Renoir	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Pierre_Auguste_Renoir_-_Portrait_Berthe_Morisot_and_daughter_Julie.jpg",

359	Impressionism	Impressionism is a 19th-century art movement that originated with a group of Paris-based artists. Their independent exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s, in spite of harsh opposition from the conventional art community in France. The name of the style derives from the title of a Claude Monet work, Impression, soleil levant (Impression, Sunrise), which provoked the critic Louis Leroy to coin the term in a satirical review published in the Parisian newspaper Le Charivari.\nImpressionist painting characteristics include relatively small, thin, yet visible brush strokes, open composition, emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time), ordinary subject matter, inclusion of movement as a crucial element of human perception and experience, and unusual visual angles. The development of Impressionism in the visual arts was soon followed by analogous styles in other media that became known as impressionist music and impressionist literature.	\N	\N	\N	http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-u1NmBVjI648/TWdfp9QurpI/AAAAAAAAAFM/oOdsba59jWQ/s1600/impressionism-1.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Hipp_hipp_hurra%21_Konstn%C3%A4rsfest_p%C3%A5_Skagen_-_Peder_Severin_Kr%C3%B8yer.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/James_Abbot_McNeill_Whistler_012.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Edouard_Manet_Boating.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Girl_with_a_Hoop.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Guillaumin_SoleilCouchantAIvry.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Hay_Harvest_at_%C3%89ragny_by_Camille_Pissarro_1901.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Edgar_Germain_Hilaire_Degas_072.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Edouard_Manet_-_Luncheon_on_the_Grass_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Edouard_Manet_004.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Edouard_Manet_039.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Gustave_Caillebotte_-_Paris_Street%3B_Rainy_Day_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Claude_Monet%2C_Impression%2C_soleil_levant%2C_1872.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Cassatt_Mary_At_the_Theater_1879.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Claude_Monet_-_Graystaks_I.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Claude_Monet%2C_Impression%2C_soleil_levant.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Claude_Monet_-_Woman_with_a_Parasol_-_Madame_Monet_and_Her_Son_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Claude_Monet_-_Jardin_%C3%A0_Sainte-Adresse.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Edgar_Degas_-_In_a_Caf%C3%A9_-_Google_Art_Project_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Claude_Monet_The_Cliffs_at_Etretat.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Edgar_Germain_Hilaire_Degas_069.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Edgar_Germain_Hilaire_Degas_032.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Vincent_Van_Gogh_0016.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/The_Child%27s_Bath_by_Mary_Cassatt_1893.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Sisley-Bridge_at_Villeneuve-la-Garenne.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Renoir_-_The_Two_Sisters%2C_On_the_Terrace.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Pierre-Auguste_Renoir%2C_Le_Moulin_de_la_Galette.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Paul_Gauguin_044.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Monet_Water_Lilies_1916.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Berthe_Morisot_Reading.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Berthe_Morisot%2C_Le_berceau_%28The_Cradle%29%2C_1872.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Camille_Pissarro_007.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Berthe_Morisot_The_Harbor_at_Lorient.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/A_Sunday_on_La_Grande_Jatte%2C_Georges_Seurat%2C_1884.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Bazille_Paysage_au_bord_du_Lez.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Alfred_Sisley_001.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Card_Players-Paul_Cezanne.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Camille_Pissarro_019.jpg"]	f	cover
368	Vincent van Gogh	Vincent Willem van Gogh (Dutch: [ˈvɪnsɛnt ˈʋɪləɱ vɑŋ ˈɣɔχ] ( ); 30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890) was a post-Impressionist painter of Dutch origin whose work, notable for its rough beauty, emotional honesty and bold color, had a far-reaching influence on 20th-century art. After years of painful anxiety and frequent bouts of mental illness, he died aged 37 from a gunshot wound, generally accepted to be self-inflicted (although no gun was ever found). His work was then known to only a handful of people and appreciated by fewer still.\nVan Gogh began to draw as a child, and he continued to draw throughout the years that led up to his decision to become an artist. He did not begin painting until his late twenties, completing many of his best-known works during the last two years of his life. In just over a decade, he produced more than 2,100 artworks, consisting of 860 oil paintings and more than 1,300 watercolors, drawings, sketches and prints. His work included self portraits, landscapes, still lifes, portraits and paintings of cypresses, wheat fields and sunflowers.\nVan Gogh spent his early adulthood working for a firm of art dealers, traveling between The Hague, London and Paris, after which he taught for a time in England at Isleworth and Ramsgate. One of his early aspirations was to become a pastor and from 1879 he worked as a missionary in a mining region in Belgium where he began to sketch people from the local community. In 1885, he painted his first major work The Potato Eaters. His palette at the time consisted mainly of somber earth tones and showed no sign of the vivid coloration that distinguished his later work. In March 1886, he moved to Paris and discovered the French Impressionists. Later, he moved to the south of France and was influenced by the strong sunlight he found there. His work grew brighter in color, and he developed the unique and highly recognizable style that became fully realized during his stay in Arles in 1888.\nThe extent to which his mental health affected his painting has been a subject of speculation since his death. Despite a widespread tendency to romanticize his ill health, modern critics see an artist deeply frustrated by the inactivity and incoherence brought about by his bouts of illness. According to art critic Robert Hughes, Van Gogh's late works show an artist at the height of his ability, completely in control and "longing for concision and grace."	\N	\N	\N	http://a2.files.saymedia-content.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_face,h_300,q_70,w_300/MTE1ODA0OTcxODExNDQwMTQx.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Vincent_Van_Gogh_0021.jpg",

380	Fyodor Dostoyevsky	Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky (Russian: Фёдор Миха́йлович Достое́вский, IPA: [ˈfʲodər mʲɪˈxajləvʲɪt͡ɕ dəstɐˈjefskʲɪj] ( ); 11 November 1821 – 9 February 1881), sometimes transliterated Dostoevsky, was a Russian novelist, short story writer, essayist and philosopher. Dostoyevsky's literary works explore human psychology in the context of the troubled political, social, and spiritual atmosphere of 19th-century Russia. He began writing in his 20s, and his first novel, Poor Folk, was published in 1846 when he was 25. His major works include Crime and Punishment (1866), The Idiot (1869), and The Brothers Karamazov (1880). His output consists of eleven novels, three novellas, seventeen short novels and numerous other works. Many literary critics rate him as one of the greatest and most prominent psychologists in world literature.\nBorn in Moscow in 1821, Dostoyevsky was introduced to literature at an early age through fairy tales and legends, and through books by Russian and foreign authors. His mother died in 1837, when he was 15, and around the same time he left school to enter the Nikolayev Military Engineering Institute. After graduating, he worked as an engineer and briefly enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, translating books to earn extra money. In the mid-1840s he wrote his first novel, Poor Folk, which gained him entry into St. Petersburg's literary circles.\nIn 1849 he was arrested for his involvement in the Petrashevsky Circle, a secret society of liberal utopians that also functioned as a literary discussion group. He and other members were condemned to death, but at the last moment, a note from Tsar Nicholas I was delivered to the scene of the firing squad, commuting the sentence to four years' hard labour in Siberia. His seizures, which may have started in 1839, increased in frequency there, and he was diagnosed with epilepsy. On his release, he was forced to serve as a soldier, before being discharged on grounds of ill health.\nIn the following years, Dostoyevsky worked as a journalist, publishing and editing several magazines of his own and later A Writer's Diary, a collection of his writings. He began to travel around western Europe and developed a gambling addiction, which led to financial hardship. For a time, he had to beg for money, but he eventually became one of the most widely read and highly regarded Russian writers. His books have been translated into more than 170 languages. Dostoyevsky influenced a multitude of writers and philosophers, from Anton Chekhov and Ernest Hemingway to Friedrich Nietzsche and Jean-Paul Sartre.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoyevsky	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Image_dost_01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Fyodor_Mikhailovich_Dostoyevsky_1876.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Mikhail_Andreyevich_Dostoyevsky.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Maria_Fyodorovna_Dostoyevskaya.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Soviet_Union_stamp_1971_CPA_4027.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Ru-Dostoevsky.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Tala_Birell-Douglass_Dumbrille_in_Crime_and_Punishment.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Valikhanov.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Trutovsky_004.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Vasily_Perov_-_%D0%9F%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%82_%D0%A4.%D0%9C.%D0%94%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Dostoyevsky_The_Demons_Manuscript.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Dostoyevsky_New_Testament.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Dostoyevsky_on_his_Bier%2C_Kramskoy.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Dostoyevsky_in_prison.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/B_pokrovsky_kazn_1849.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Dostoyevsky%27s_funeral.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Dostoevskij_1863.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Fyodor_Dostoyevsky_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Dresden_Dostojewski-Denkmal.JPG"]	f	cover
387	League of Nations	The League of Nations (abbreviated as LN in English, "Société des Nations" abbreviated as SDN in French) was an intergovernmental organisation founded as a result of the Paris Peace Conference that ended the First World War. It was the first international organisation whose principal mission was to maintain world peace. Its primary goals, as stated in its Covenant, included preventing wars through collective security and disarmament, and settling international disputes through negotiation and arbitration. Other issues in this and related treaties included labour conditions, just treatment of native inhabitants, human and drug trafficking, arms trade, global health, prisoners of war, and protection of minorities in Europe. At its greatest extent from 28 September 1934 to 23 February 1935, it had 58 members.\nThe diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift from the preceding hundred years. The League lacked its own armed force and depended on the Great Powers to enforce its resolutions, keep to its economic sanctions, or provide an army when needed. However, the Great Powers were often reluctant to do so. Sanctions could hurt League members, so they were reluctant to comply with them. When, during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, the League accused Italian soldiers of targeting Red Cross medical tents, Benito Mussolini responded that "the League is very well when sparrows shout, but no good at all when eagles fall out."\nAfter a number of notable successes and some early failures in the 1920s, the League ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the Axis powers in the 1930s. Germany withdrew from the League, as did Japan, Italy, Spain, and others. The onset of the Second World War showed that the League had failed its primary purpose, which was to prevent any future world war. The League lasted for 27 years; the United Nations (UN) replaced it after the end of the Second World War and inherited a number of agencies and organisations founded by the League.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Wikinews-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Original_Geneva_Conventions.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Origin_of_the_League_of_Nations.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/SelassieInJerusalem.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Palais_des_nations.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Symbol_of_the_League_of_Nations.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Sesi%C3%B3nDeLaSociedadDeNacionesSobreManchuria1932.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Thomas_Woodrow_Wilson%2C_Harris_%26_Ewing_bw_photo_portrait%2C_1919.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/The_Gap_in_the_Bridge.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/UN_building%2C_Genevra.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Small_Flag_of_the_United_Nations_ZP.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/James_Bryce%2C_1st_Viscount_Bryce_cph.3b16400.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Fokker_Dr._I_%28117710246%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/LN_member_states_animation.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Kamerun_children_weaving.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Childlabourcoal.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Flag_of_the_United_Nations_%281945-1947%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Flag_of_Switzerland.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Nansenpassport.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/League_of_Nations_Anachronous_Map.png"]	f	cover
384	Triple Entente	The Triple Entente (from French entente [ɑ̃tɑ̃t] "friendship, understanding, agreement") was the alliance linking Russia, France, and the United Kingdom after the signing of the Anglo-Russian Entente on August 31, 1907. The alliance of the three powers, supplemented by agreements with Portugal and Japan, constituted a powerful counterweight to the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy.\nHistorians continue to debate the importance of the alliance system in igniting the Great War. At the start of World War I in 1914, all three of the Triple Entente entered it as Allies against the Central Powers Germany and Austria-Hungary.	\N	\N	\N	http://pottswwi.wikispaces.com/file/view/tripleentente.jpg/141415357/tripleentente.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Entente	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Fokker_Dr._I_%28117710246%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Triple_Entente.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Map_Europe_alliances_1914-en.svg"]	f	cover
390	Vladimir Lenin	Vladimir Ilyich Lenin (Russian: Владимир Ильич Ленин, IPA: [vɫɐˈdʲimʲɪr ɪlʲˈjit͡ɕ ˈlʲenʲɪn] ( ); born Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov; 22 April [O.S. 10 April] 1870 – 21 January 1924) was a Russian communist revolutionary, politician and political theorist. He served as the leader of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic from 1917, and then concurrently as Premier of the Soviet Union from 1922, until his death. Politically a Marxist, his theoretical contributions to Marxist thought are known as Leninism, which coupled with Marxian economic theory have collectively come to be known as Marxism–Leninism.\nBorn to a wealthy middle-class family in Simbirsk, Lenin gained an interest in revolutionary leftist politics following the execution of his brother Aleksandr in 1887. Expelled from Kazan State University for participating in anti-Tsarist protests, he devoted the following years to a law degree and to radical politics, becoming a Marxist. In 1893 he moved to St Petersburg, and became a senior figure in the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). Arrested for sedition and exiled to Siberia for three years, he married Nadezhda Krupskaya, and fled to Western Europe, living in Germany, France, England, and Switzerland, where he became known as a prominent party theorist. In 1903, he took a key role in the RSDLP schism, leading the Bolshevik faction against Julius Martov's Mensheviks. Briefly returning to Russia during the Revolution of 1905, he encouraged violent insurrection, and later campaigned for the First World War to be transformed into a Europe-wide proletariat revolution. After the 1917 February Revolution ousted the Tsar he returned to Russia.\nLenin played a senior role in orchestrating the October Revolution in 1917, which led to the overthrow of the Provisional Government and the establishment of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, the world's first constitutionally socialist state. Immediately afterwards, the new government under Lenin's leadership proceeded to implement socialist reforms, including the transfer of estates and crown lands to workers' soviets. He supported world revolution and immediate peace with the Central Powers, agreeing to a punitive treaty that turned over much of the former Russian Empire to Germany. The treaty was voided after the Allies won the war. In 1921 Lenin proposed the New Economic Policy, a system of state capitalism that started the process of industrialisation and recovery from the Civil War. In 1922, the Russian SFSR joined former territories of the Russian Empire in becoming the Soviet Union, with Lenin elected as its leader.\nAfter his death, Marxism–Leninism developed into a variety of schools of thought, namely Stalinism, Trotskyism and Maoism. Lenin remains a controversial and highly divisive world figure. Detractors label him a dictator whose administration oversaw multiple human rights abuses, while supporters reject this criticism and promote him as a champion of the working class. Lenin had a significant influence on the international Communist movement and was one of the most influential and controversial figures of the 20th century.	\N	\N	\N	http://www.isfp.co.uk/images/vladimir_lenin.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Lenin-1895-mugshot.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/86/Lenin_Age_4.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/64/October_film_Lenin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Russian_coa_1917_vrem.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Mcita_murutsxi.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Pogrzeb_Lenina1924.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Ru-Lenin.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Lenin_Statue_outside_Finland_Station_-_St._Petersburg_-_Russia.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/Lenin_and_stalin_crop.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Lenin_buhar.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/MartovW.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e0/Symbol_question.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/aa/Tov_lenin_ochishchaet.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Kulikov_Lenin_1924.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/KrupskayaPhoto.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Lenin-circa-1887.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Lenin%27s_funerals_by_I.Brodsky_%281925%29_detail_01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Lenin-office-1918.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Lenin-last-photo.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Lenin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Lenin.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Lenin_CL.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Lenin_05d.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5c/Symbol_template_class.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/%D0%94%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D0%B2_%D0%91%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BD.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Unterschrift_Lenins.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/URSS_1_rublo_centenario_nascita_Lenin.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Symbol-hammer-and-sickle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Coat_of_Arms_of_Russian_Empire.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Brodskiy%27s_Lenin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Coat_of_arms_of_the_Soviet_Union.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Coat_of_Arms_of_the_Russian_Federation.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/5_May_1919-Trotsky_Lenin_Kamenev.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/A_A_Bogdanov.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/5_May_1919-Trotsky_Lenin_Kamenev.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/01/A_coloured_voting_box.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Iskra.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Flag_of_the_Soviet_Union.svg"]	f	contain
399	Jazz Age	The Jazz Age was a feature of the 1920s (ending with The Great Depression) when jazz music and dance became popular. This occurred particularly in the United States, but also in Britain, France and elsewhere. Jazz played a significant part in wider cultural changes during the period, and its influence on pop culture continued long afterwards. Jazz music originated mainly in New Orleans, and is/was a fusion of African and European music. The Jazz Age is often referred to in conjunction with the phenomenon referred to as the Roaring Twenties. The term "Jazz Age" was coined by F. Scott Fitzgerald.\n	\N	\N	\N	http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OM5PgRB2TkI/UXE_zKpiHhI/AAAAAAAAdNc/awiMqidQfro/s1600/bryan-ferry-the-jazz-age1.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_Age	[]	f	cover
391	Joseph Stalin	Joseph Stalin or Iosif Vissarionovich Stalin (Russian: Ио́сиф Виссарио́нович Ста́лин, pronounced [ˈjosʲɪf vʲɪsɐˈrʲonəvʲɪt͡ɕ ˈstalʲɪn]; born Ioseb Besarionis Dze Jugashvili, Georgian: იოსებ ბესარიონის ძე ჯუღაშვილი, pronounced [iɔsɛb bɛsariɔnis d͡ze d͡ʒuɣaʃvili]; 18 December 1878 – 5 March 1953), was the leader of the Soviet Union from the mid-1920s until his death in 1953.\nAmong the Bolshevik revolutionaries who took part in the Russian Revolution of 1917, Stalin was appointed general secretary of the party's Central Committee in 1922. He subsequently managed to consolidate power following the 1924 death of Vladimir Lenin through suppressing Lenin's criticisms (in the postscript of his testament) and expanding the functions of his role, all the while eliminating any opposition. By the late 1920s, he was the unchallenged leader of the Soviet Union. He remained general secretary until the post was abolished in 1952, concurrently serving as the Premier of the Soviet Union from 1941 onward.\nUnder Stalin's rule, the concept of "socialism in one country" became a central tenet of Soviet society. He replaced the New Economic Policy introduced by Lenin in the early 1920s with a highly centralised command economy, launching a period of industrialization and collectivization that resulted in the rapid transformation of the USSR from an agrarian society into an industrial power. However, the economic changes coincided with the imprisonment of millions of people in correctional labour camps and the deportation of many others to remote areas. The initial upheaval in agriculture disrupted food production and contributed to the catastrophic Soviet famine of 1932–1933, known as the Holodomor in Ukraine. Later, in a period that lasted from 1936 to 1939, Stalin instituted a campaign against alleged enemies within his regime, called the Great Purge, in which hundreds of thousands were executed. Major figures in the Communist Party, such as the old Bolsheviks, Leon Trotsky, and several Red Army leaders, were killed after being convicted of plotting to overthrow the government and Stalin.\nIn August 1939, Stalin entered into a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany that divided their influence and territory within Eastern Europe, resulting in their invasion of Poland in September of that year, but Germany later violated the agreement and launched a massive invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. Despite heavy human and territorial losses, Soviet forces managed to halt the Nazi incursion after the decisive Battles of Moscow and Stalingrad. After defeating the Axis powers on the Eastern Front, the Red Army captured Berlin in May 1945, effectively ending the war in Europe for the Allies. The Soviet Union subsequently emerged as one of two recognized world superpowers, the other being the United States. The Yalta and Potsdam conferences established communist governments loyal to the Soviet Union in the Eastern Bloc countries as buffer states, which Stalin deemed necessary in case of another invasion. He also fostered close relations with Mao Zedong in China and Kim Il-sung in North Korea.\nStalin led the Soviet Union through its post-war reconstruction phase, which saw a significant rise in tension with the Western world that would later be known as the Cold War. During this period, the USSR became the second country in the world to successfully develop a nuclear weapon, as well as launching the Great Plan for the Transformation of Nature in response to another widespread famine and the Great Construction Projects of Communism. In the years following his death, Stalin and his regime have been condemned on numerous occasions, most notably in 1956 when his successor Nikita Khrushchev denounced his legacy and initiated a process of de-Stalinization. He remains a controversial figure today, with many regarding him as a tyrant similar to his wartime enemy Adolf Hitler; however, popular opinion within the Russian Federation is mixed.	\N	\N	\N	http://cdn1.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/images/joseph-stalin-1.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg",

405	Dada	Dada /ˈdɑːdɑː/ or Dadaism was an art movement of the European avant-garde in the early 20th century. Many say Dada began in Zurich, Switzerland in 1916, spreading to Berlin shortly thereafter but the height of New York Dada was the year before in 1915. To quote Dona Budd's The Language of Art Knowledge,\n\nDada was born out of negative reaction to the horrors of World War I. This international movement was begun by a group of artists and poets associated with the Cabaret Voltaire in Zurich. Dada rejected reason and logic, prizing nonsense, irrationality and intuition. The origin of the name Dada is unclear; some believe that it is a nonsensical word. Others maintain that it originates from the Romanian artists Tristan Tzara's and Marcel Janco's frequent use of the words "da, da," meaning "yes, yes" in the Romanian language. Another theory says that the name "Dada" came during a meeting of the group when a paper knife stuck into a French-German dictionary happened to point to 'dada', a French word for 'hobbyhorse'.\n\nThe movement primarily involved visual arts, literature, poetry, art manifestoes, art theory, theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti-war politics through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through anti-art cultural works. In addition to being anti-war, Dada was also anti-bourgeois and had political affinities with the radical left.\n\nDada activities included public gatherings, demonstrations, and publication of art/literary journals; passionate coverage of art, politics, and culture were topics often discussed in a variety of media. Key figures in the movement included Hugo Ball, Emmy Hennings, Hans Arp, Raoul Hausmann, Hannah Höch, Johannes Baader, Tristan Tzara, Francis Picabia, Richard Huelsenbeck, George Grosz, John Heartfield, Marcel Duchamp, Beatrice Wood, Kurt Schwitters, and Hans Richter, among others. The movement influenced later styles like the avant-garde and downtown music movements, and groups including surrealism, Nouveau réalisme, pop art and Fluxus.\nMarc Lowenthal, in I Am a Beautiful Monster: Poetry, Prose, And Provocation, tells us:\n\nDada is the groundwork to abstract art and sound poetry, a starting point for performance art, a prelude to postmodernism, an influence on pop art, a celebration of antiart to be later embraced for anarcho-political uses in the 1960s and the movement that lay the foundation for Surrealism.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dada	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/49/MechanicalHead-Hausmann.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/df/ABCD-Hausmann.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2b/Francis_Picabia%2C_Dame%21_Illustration_for_the_cover_of_the_periodical_Dadaphone_n._7%2C_Paris%2C_March_1920.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f7/Dada1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/89/Francis_Picabia%2C_1915%2C_New_York..jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6b/Hoch-Cut_With_the_Kitchen_Knife.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Duchamp_Fountaine.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/RroseSelavy.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/En_hod_dada_museum.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/26/An_Anna_Blume.jpg"]	f	cover
406	Surrealism	Surrealism is a cultural movement that began in the early 1920s, and is best known for its visual artworks and writings. The aim was to "resolve the previously contradictory conditions of dream and reality." Artists painted unnerving, illogical scenes with photographic precision, created strange creatures from everyday objects and developed painting techniques that allowed the unconscious to express itself and/or an idea/concept. \nSurrealist works feature the element of surprise, unexpected juxtapositions and non sequitur; however, many Surrealist artists and writers regard their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost, with the works being an artifact. Leader André Breton was explicit in his assertion that Surrealism was above all, a revolutionary movement.\nSurrealism developed out of the Dada activities during World War I and the most important center of the movement was Paris. From the 1920s onward, the movement spread around the globe, eventually affecting the visual arts, literature, film, and music of many countries and languages, as well as political thought and practice, philosophy, and social theory.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealism	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/cc/ElleLogeLaFolie_1970.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2b/The_Elephant_Celebes.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/db/L%27Ange_du_Foyeur.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7d/Masson_automatic_drawing.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/de/La_Revolution_Surrealiste_cover.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/10/%27Woman_with_Her_Throat_Cut%27%2C_a_flor_piece_by_Giacometti%2C_1932_%28cast_1949%29%2C_Museum_of_Modern_Art%2C_%28New_York_City%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b9/MagrittePipe.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Socrates.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/Indefinite_Divisibility.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/Tanning_Etched_Murmurs_col.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/97/The_Red_Tower.jpg"]	f	cover
413	George Orwell	Eric Arthur Blair (25 June 1903 – 21 January 1950), known by his pen name George Orwell, was an English novelist, essayist, journalist and critic. His work is marked by lucid prose, awareness of social injustice, opposition to totalitarianism, and commitment to democratic socialism.\nCommonly ranked as one of the most influential English writers of the 20th century and as one of the most important chroniclers of English culture of his generation, Orwell wrote literary criticism, poetry, fiction and polemical journalism. He is best known for the dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) and the allegorical novella Animal Farm (1945). His book Homage to Catalonia (1938), an account of his experiences in the Spanish Civil War, is widely acclaimed, as are his numerous essays on politics, literature, language, and culture. In 2008, The Times ranked him second on a list of "The 50 greatest British writers since 1945".\nOrwell's work continues to influence popular and political culture, and the term Orwellian — descriptive of totalitarian or authoritarian social practices — has entered the language together with several of his neologisms, including cold war, Big Brother, thought police, Room 101, doublethink, and thoughtcrime.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ed/KatharBritishClub.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c2/Orwell-Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/50/Placegeorgeorwell.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/StCyprians.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/eb/OrwellBurmaPassport.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Wigan_Pier_-_geograph.org.uk_-_4175.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/UCL_Gower_Street.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5c/Orwell_hampstead_home.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Southwold_North_Parade.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/Grave_of_Eric_Arthur_Blair_%28George_Orwell%29%2C_All_Saints%2C_Sutton_Courtenay_-_geograph.org.uk_-_362277.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/George_Orwell_press_photo.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/River_Orwell_Shore_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1044570.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Portobello_Road_-_George_Orwell_House.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/24_Crooms_Hill%2C_Greenwich%2C_London-11July2010.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/George_Orwell_in_Hampstead_-_geograph.org.uk_-_432863.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Barnhill_%28Cnoc_an_t-Sabhail%29_-_geograph.org.uk_-_451643.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/ShiplakeBlairHome01.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Rue_du_Pot-de-Fer.JPG"]	f	cover
439	Vietnam	Vietnam (/ˌviːətˈnɑːm/, /viˌɛt-/, /-ˈnæm/, /ˌvjɛt-/; Vietnamese pronunciation: [viət˨ naːm˧] ( )), officially the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV; Cộng hòa Xã hội chủ nghĩa Việt Nam ( listen)), is the easternmost country on the Indochina Peninsula in Southeast Asia. With an estimated 90.3 million inhabitants as of 2012, it is the world's 13th-most-populous country, and the eighth-most-populous Asian country. The name Vietnam translates as "Southern Viet" (synonymous with the much older term Nam Viet); it was first officially adopted in 1802 by Emperor Gia Long, and was adopted again in 1945 with the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam under Ho Chi Minh. The country is bordered by China to the north, Laos to the northwest, Cambodia to the southwest, and the South China Sea to the east. Its capital city has been Hanoi since the reunification of North and South Vietnam in 1976.\nThe Vietnamese became independent from Imperial China in AD 938, following the resounding Vietnamese victory in the Battle of Bạch Đằng River. Successive Vietnamese royal dynasties flourished as the nation expanded geographically and politically into Southeast Asia, until the Indochina Peninsula was colonized by the French in the mid-19th century. Following a Japanese occupation in the 1940s, the Vietnamese fought French rule in the First Indochina War, eventually expelling the French in 1954. Thereafter, Vietnam was divided politically into two rival states, North and South Vietnam. Conflict between the two sides intensified, with heavy intervention from the United States, in what is known as the Vietnam War. The war ended with a North Vietnamese victory in 1975.\nVietnam was then unified under a Communist government but remained impoverished and politically isolated. In 1986, the government initiated a series of economic and political reforms which began Vietnam's path towards integration into the world economy. By 2000, it had established diplomatic relations with most nations. Since 2000, Vietnam's economic growth rate has been among the highest in the world, and, in 2011, it had the highest Global Growth Generators Index among 11 major economies. Its successful economic reforms resulted in its joining the World Trade Organization in 2007.\nHowever, regardless of the advancements that have been made in recent years, the country still experiences high levels of income inequality, disparities in access to healthcare, and a lack of gender equality.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Presidential_Palace_Hanoi_388606781_40a24f0ceb.jpg",

402	Franklin D. Roosevelt	Franklin Delano Roosevelt (/ˈroʊzəvəlt/ ROH-zə-vəlt, his own pronunciation, or /ˈroʊzəvɛlt/ ROH-zə-velt) (January 30, 1882 – April 12, 1945), commonly known by his initials FDR, was an American lawyer and statesman who served as the 32nd President of the United States. Serving from March 1933 to his death in April 1945, he was elected for four consecutive terms, and remains the only president ever to serve more than eight years. He was a central figure in world events during the mid-20th century, leading the United States during a time of worldwide economic depression and total war. A dominant leader of the Democratic Party, he built a New Deal Coalition that realigned American politics after 1932, as his New Deal domestic policies defined American liberalism for the middle third of the 20th century.\nWith the bouncy popular song "Happy Days Are Here Again" as his campaign theme, FDR defeated incumbent Republican Herbert Hoover in November 1932, at the depth of the Great Depression. Energized by his personal victory over polio, FDR's persistent optimism and activism contributed to a renewal of the national spirit. Assisted by key aide Harry Hopkins, he worked closely with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in leading the Allies against Nazi Germany and Japan in World War II.\nIn his first hundred days in office, which began March 4, 1933, Roosevelt spearheaded major legislation and issued a profusion of executive orders that instituted the New Deal—a variety of programs designed to produce relief (government jobs for the unemployed), recovery (economic growth), and reform (through regulation of Wall Street, banks and transportation). The economy improved rapidly from 1933 to 1937, but then relapsed into a deep recession. The bipartisan Conservative Coalition that formed in 1937 prevented his packing the Supreme Court or passing any considerable legislation; it abolished many of the relief programs when unemployment practically vanished during the war. Most of the regulations on business were ended about 1975–1985, except for the regulation of Wall Street by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which still exists. Along with several smaller programs, major surviving programs include the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which was created in 1933, and Social Security, which Congress passed in 1935.\nAs World War II loomed after 1938, with the Japanese invasion of China and the aggression of Nazi Germany, FDR gave strong diplomatic and financial support to China and Great Britain, while remaining officially neutral. His goal was to make America the "Arsenal of Democracy" which would supply munitions to the Allies. In March 1941, Roosevelt, with Congressional approval, provided Lend-Lease aid to the countries fighting against Nazi Germany with England, Scotland, and Wales. With very strong national support, he made war on Japan and Germany after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, calling it a "date which will live in infamy". He supervised the mobilization of the U.S. economy to support the Allied war effort. As an active military leader, Roosevelt implemented an overall war strategy on two fronts that ended in the defeat of the Axis Powers and the development of the world's first atom bomb. In 1942 Roosevelt ordered the internment of 100,000 Japanese American civilians.\nUnemployment dropped to 2%, relief programs largely ended, and the industrial economy grew rapidly to new heights as millions of people moved to new jobs in war centers, and 16 million men and 300,000 women were drafted or volunteered for military service. All economic sectors grew during the war. Farm output went from an index (by volume) of 106 in 1939 to 128 in 1943. Coal output went from 446 million tons in 1939 to 651 in 1943; oil from 1.3 billion barrels to 1.5 billion. Manufacturing output doubled, from an index of 109 in 1939 to 239 in 1943. Railroads strained to move it all to market, from an output of 13.6 billion loaded car miles in 1939 to 23.3 in 1943.\nRoosevelt dominated the American political scene during the twelve years of his presidency, and his policies and ideas continued to have significant impacts for decades afterward. He orchestrated the realignment of voters that created the Fifth Party System. FDR's New Deal Coalition united labor unions, big city machines, white ethnics, African Americans, and rural white Southerners. His work also influenced the later creation of the United Nations and Bretton Woods. Roosevelt is consistently rated by scholars as one of the top three U.S. Presidents, along with Abraham Lincoln and George Washington.	\N	\N	\N	http://www.presidentprofiles.com/images/prh_01_img0065.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg",

452	Jackson Pollock	Paul Jackson Pollock (January 28, 1912 – August 11, 1956), known as Jackson Pollock, was an influential American painter and a major figure in the abstract expressionist movement. He was well known for his unique style of drip painting.\nDuring his lifetime, Pollock enjoyed considerable fame and notoriety, a major artist of his generation. Regarded as reclusive, he had a volatile personality, and struggled with alcoholism for most of his life. In 1945, he married the artist Lee Krasner, who became an important influence on his career and on his legacy.\nPollock died at the age of 44 in an alcohol-related, single-car accident; he was driving. In December 1956, several months after his death, Pollock was given a memorial retrospective exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City. A larger, more comprehensive exhibition of his work was held there in 1967. In 1998 and 1999, his work was honored with large-scale retrospective exhibitions at MoMA and at The Tate in London.\nIn 2000, Jackson Pollock was the subject of an Academy Award-winning film Pollock directed by and starring Ed Harris.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Pollock	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2a/Lavender_Mist.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/42/Namuth_-_Pollock.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/No._5%2C_1948.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Pollock-green.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Pollock-barn.jpg"]	f	cover
430	Midway	The SEC Men's Basketball Tournament (sometimes known simply as the SEC Tournament) is the conference tournament in basketball for the Southeastern Conference (SEC). It is a single-elimination tournament that involves all league schools (currently 14). Its seeding is based on regular season records. The winner receives the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA men's basketball tournament, however the official conference championship is awarded to the team or teams with the best regular season record.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midway	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/SEC_new_logo.png"]	f	cover
435	NATO	The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO; /ˈneɪtoʊ/ NAY-toh; French: Organisation du traité de l'Atlantique Nord (OTAN)), also called the (North) Atlantic Alliance, is an intergovernmental military alliance based on the North Atlantic Treaty which was signed on 4 April 1949. The organization constitutes a system of collective defence whereby its member states agree to mutual defense in response to an attack by any external party. NATO's headquarters are in Brussels, Belgium, one of the 28 member states across North America and Europe, the newest of which, Albania and Croatia, joined in April 2009. An additional 22 countries participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, with 15 other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programmes. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70% of the world's defence spending. Members' defense spending is supposed to amount to 2% of GDP.\nNATO was little more than a political association until the Korean War galvanized the organization's member states, and an integrated military structure was built up under the direction of two U.S. supreme commanders. The course of the Cold War led to a rivalry with nations of the Warsaw Pact, which formed in 1955. Doubts over the strength of the relationship between the European states and the United States ebbed and flowed, along with doubts over the credibility of the NATO defence against a prospective Soviet invasion—doubts that led to the development of the independent French nuclear deterrent and the withdrawal of the French from NATO's military structure in 1966 for 30 years. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the organization was drawn into the breakup of Yugoslavia, and conducted its first military interventions in Bosnia from 1992 to 1995 and later Yugoslavia in 1999. Politically, the organization sought better relations with former Warsaw Pact countries, several of which joined the alliance in 1999 and 2004.\nArticle 5 of the North Atlantic treaty, requiring member states to come to the aid of any member state subject to an armed attack, was invoked for the first and only time after the 11 September 2001 attacks, after which troops were deployed to Afghanistan under the NATO-led ISAF. The organization has operated a range of additional roles since then, including sending trainers to Iraq, assisting in counter-piracy operations and in 2011 enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya in accordance with U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973. The less potent Article 4, which merely invokes consultation among NATO members, has been invoked four times: by Turkey in 2003 over the Iraq War, twice in 2012 by Turkey over the Syrian Civil War after the downing of an unarmed Turkish F-4 reconnaissance jet and after a mortar was fired at Turkey from Syria and by Poland in 2014 following the Russian intervention in Crimea.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg",

421	Winston Churchill	Sir Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill, KG, OM, CH, TD, DL, FRS, RA (30 November 1874 – 24 January 1965) was a British politician who was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945 and again from 1951 to 1955. Widely regarded as one of the greatest wartime leaders of the 20th century, Churchill was also an officer in the British Army, a historian, a writer, and an artist. He is the only British Prime Minister to have won the Nobel Prize in Literature, and was the first person to be made an honorary citizen of the United States.\nChurchill was born into the aristocratic family of the Dukes of Marlborough, a branch of the Spencer family. His father, Lord Randolph Churchill, was a charismatic politician who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer; his mother, Jennie Jerome, was an American socialite. As a young army officer, he saw action in British India, the Sudan, and the Second Boer War. He gained fame as a war correspondent and wrote books about his campaigns.\nAt the forefront of politics for fifty years, he held many political and cabinet positions. Before the First World War, he served as President of the Board of Trade, Home Secretary, and First Lord of the Admiralty as part of the Asquith Liberal government. During the war, he continued as First Lord of the Admiralty until the disastrous Gallipoli Campaign caused his departure from government. He then briefly resumed active army service on the Western Front as commander of the 6th Battalion of the Royal Scots Fusiliers. He returned to government as Minister of Munitions, Secretary of State for War, and Secretary of State for Air. After the War, Churchill served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Conservative (Baldwin) government of 1924–29, controversially returning the pound sterling in 1925 to the gold standard at its pre-war parity, a move widely seen as creating deflationary pressure on the UK economy. Also controversial were his opposition to increased home rule for India and his resistance to the 1936 abdication of Edward VIII.\nOut of office and politically "in the wilderness" during the 1930s, Churchill took the lead in warning about Nazi Germany and in campaigning for rearmament. On the outbreak of the Second World War, he was again appointed First Lord of the Admiralty. Following the resignation of Neville Chamberlain on 10 May 1940, Churchill became Prime Minister. His steadfast refusal to consider defeat, surrender, or a compromise peace helped inspire British resistance, especially during the difficult early days of the War when Britain stood alone in its active opposition to Adolf Hitler. Churchill was particularly noted for his speeches and radio broadcasts, which helped inspire the British people. He led Britain as Prime Minister until victory over Nazi Germany had been secured.\nAfter the Conservative Party lost the 1945 election, he became Leader of the Opposition to the Labour Government. After winning the 1951 election, he again became Prime Minister, before retiring in 1955. Upon his death, Elizabeth II granted him the honour of a state funeral, which saw one of the largest assemblies of world statesmen in history. Named the Greatest Briton of all time in a 2002 poll, Churchill is widely regarded as being among the most influential people in British history, consistently ranking well in opinion polls of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Churchill_portrait_NYP_45063.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Winston_Churchill_%28Part_1%29.ogg",

436	Warsaw Pact	The Warsaw Pact (formally, the Treaty of Friendship, Co-operation, and Mutual Assistance) was a mutual defense treaty among eight communist States of Central and Eastern Europe in existence during the Cold War. The founding treaty was established under the initiative of the Soviet Union and signed on 14 May 1955, in Warsaw. The Warsaw Pact was the military complement to the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CoMEcon), the regional economic organization for the communist States of Central and Eastern Europe. The Warsaw Pact was in part a Soviet military reaction to the integration of West Germany into NATO in 1955, per the Paris Pacts of 1954 but was primarily motivated by Soviet desires to maintain control over military forces in Central and Eastern Europe which in turn (according to The Warsaw Pact's preamble) to maintain peace in Europe, guided by the objective points and principles of the Charter of the United Nations (1945) after the collapse of the USSR and the end of the Cold War. The alliance was transformed into the subsequent Collective Security Treaty Organization, or CSTO.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Flag_of_the_Soviet_Union.svg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Pact	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Warsaw-stamp.jpg",

419	Dwight D. Eisenhower	Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower (pronounced /ˈaɪzənhaʊər/, EYE-zən-how-ər; October 14, 1890 – March 28, 1969) was the 34th President of the United States from 1953 until 1961. He was a five-star general in the United States Army during World War II and served as Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe; he had responsibility for planning and supervising the invasion of North Africa in Operation Torch in 1942–43 and the successful invasion of France and Germany in 1944–45 from the Western Front. In 1951, he became the first supreme commander of NATO.\nEisenhower was of Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry and was raised in a large family in Kansas by parents with a strong religious background. He attended and graduated from West Point and later married and had two sons. After World War II, Eisenhower served as Army Chief of Staff under President Harry S. Truman then assumed the post of President at Columbia University.\nEisenhower entered the 1952 presidential race as a Republican to counter the non-interventionism of Senator Robert A. Taft and to crusade against "Communism, Korea and corruption". He won by a landslide, defeating Democrat Adlai Stevenson and ending two decades of the New Deal Coalition. In the first year of his presidency, Eisenhower deposed the leader of Iran in the 1953 Iranian coup d'état and used nuclear threats to conclude the Korean War with China. His New Look policy of nuclear deterrence gave priority to inexpensive nuclear weapons while reducing the funding for conventional military forces; the goal was to keep pressure on the Soviet Union and reduce federal deficits. In 1954, Eisenhower first articulated the domino theory in his description of the threat presented by the spread of communism. The Congress agreed to his request in 1955 for the Formosa Resolution, which enabled him to prevent Chinese communist aggression against Chinese nationalists and established the U.S. policy of defending Taiwan. When the Soviets launched Sputnik in 1957, he had to play catch-up in the space race. Eisenhower forced Israel, the UK, and France to end their invasion of Egypt during the Suez Crisis of 1956. In 1958, he sent 15,000 U.S. troops to Lebanon to prevent the pro-Western government from falling to a Nasser-inspired revolution. Near the end of his term, his efforts to set up a summit meeting with the Soviets collapsed because of the U-2 incident. In his 1961 farewell address to the nation, Eisenhower expressed his concerns about future dangers of massive military spending, especially deficit spending, and coined the term "military–industrial complex".\nOn the domestic front, he covertly opposed Joseph McCarthy and contributed to the end of McCarthyism by openly invoking the modern expanded version of executive privilege. He otherwise left most political activity to his Vice President, Richard Nixon. He was a moderate conservative who continued New Deal agencies and expanded Social Security.\nAmong his enduring innovations, he launched the Interstate Highway System; the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which led to the internet, among many invaluable outputs; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), driving peaceful discovery in space; the establishment of strong science education via the National Defense Education Act; and encouraging peaceful use of nuclear power via amendments to the Atomic Energy Act.\nIn social policy, he sent federal troops to Little Rock, Arkansas, for the first time since Reconstruction to enforce federal court orders to desegregate public schools. He also signed civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 to protect the right to vote. He implemented desegregation of the armed forces in two years and made five appointments to the Supreme Court. He was the first term-limited president in accordance with the 22nd Amendment. Eisenhower's two terms were peaceful ones for the most part and saw considerable economic prosperity except for a sharp recession in 1958–59. Eisenhower is often ranked highly among the U.S. presidents.	\N	\N	\N	http://c250.columbia.edu/images/c250_celebrates/remarkable_columbians/240x240_eisenhower.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg",

429	Marshall Plan	The Marshall Plan (officially the European Recovery Program, ERP) was the American initiative to aid Europe, in which the United States gave economic support to help rebuild European economies after the end of World War II in order to prevent the spread of Soviet Communism. The plan was in operation for four years beginning in April 1948. The goals of the United States were to rebuild war-devastated regions, remove trade barriers, modernize industry, and make Europe prosperous again. The phrase "equivalent of the Marshall Plan" is often used to describe a proposed large-scale rescue program.\nThe initiative was named after Secretary of State George Marshall. The plan had bipartisan support in Washington, where the Republicans controlled Congress and the Democrats controlled the White House. The Plan was largely the creation of State Department officials, especially William L. Clayton and George F. Kennan, with help from Brookings Institution, as requested by Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Marshall spoke of an urgent need to help the European recovery in his address at Harvard University in June 1947.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/86/2003_Austria_20_Euro_The_Post-War_Period_back.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Plan	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/86/2003_Austria_20_Euro_The_Post-War_Period_back.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1a/Marshall_plan.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Warsaw_Pact_Logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Sound-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/State_Flag_of_Greece_%281863-1924_and_1935-1970%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/State_Flag_of_Greece_%281863-1924_and_1935-1970%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/US-MarshallPlanAid-Logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Flag_of_Portugal.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Flag_of_Norway.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Flag_of_Turkey.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Flag_of_Switzerland.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Free_Territory_Trieste_Flag.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Marshall_Plan.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Harry_S_Truman_-_NARA_-_530677_%282%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Marshall_plan_page_1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Marshall_Plan_poster.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/03/Flag_of_Italy.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4c/Flag_of_Sweden.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Flag_of_Belgium_%28civil%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Flag_of_Austria.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Flag_of_Iceland.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Flag_of_Denmark.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-B0527-0001-753%2C_Krefeld%2C_Hungerwinter%2C_Demonstration.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Europe_green_light.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/DBP_1960_344_George_C._Marshall.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Flag_of_Luxembourg.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Flag_of_Ireland.svg"]	f	70%

232	Loyalist (American Revolution)	Loyalists were American colonists who remained loyal to the British Empire and the British monarchy during the American Revolutionary War. At the time they were often called Tories, Royalists, or King's Men. They were opposed by the Patriots, those who supported the revolution. When their cause was defeated, about 15% of the Loyalists or 65-70,000 fled to other parts of the British Empire, in Britain or elsewhere in British North America. The southern colonists moved mostly to Florida, which had remained loyal to the Crown, and to British Caribbean possessions, while northern colonists largely migrated to Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, where they were called United Empire Loyalists. Most were compensated with Canadian land or British cash distributed through formal claims procedures.\nHistorians have estimated that between 15 and 20 percent of the 2.5 million whites in the colonies were Loyalists, or about 500,000 men, women and children.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalist_(American_Revolution)	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Shelburnewaterfront.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Reception_of_the_American_Loyalists.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Tory_Refugees_by_Howard_Pyle.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/DodgerBlue_flag_waving.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Jury_finding_Kentucky_County_Virginia_John_Connolly_Daniel_Boone_1780.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Johnson_Hall%2C_Johnstown%2C_NY.jpg"]	f	cover
448	J. R. R. Tolkien	John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, CBE (/ˈtɒlkiːn/ TOL-keen; 3 January 1892 – 2 September 1973) was an English writer, poet, philologist, and university professor, best known as the author of the classic high fantasy works The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Silmarillion.\nHe served as the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and Fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford, from 1925 to 1945 and Merton Professor of English Language and Literature and Fellow of Merton College, Oxford from 1945 to 1959. He was at one time a close friend of C. S. Lewis—they were both members of the informal literary discussion group known as the Inklings. Tolkien was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 March 1972.\nAfter his father's death, Tolkien's son Christopher published a series of works based on his father's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including The Silmarillion. These, together with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about a fantasy world called Arda, and Middle-earth within it. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the term legendarium to the larger part of these writings. While many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the great success of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings led directly to a popular resurgence of the genre. This has caused Tolkien to be popularly identified as the "father" of modern fantasy literature—or, more precisely, of high fantasy.\nIn 2008, The Times ranked him sixth on a list of "The 50 greatest British writers since 1945". Forbes ranked him the 5th top-earning "dead celebrity" in 2009.	\N	\N	\N	http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9gyLZEwQu-4/UGDGxIU_BhI/AAAAAAAAB3k/HqYgevmE4jE/s1600/John-Ronald-Reuel-Tolkien-10.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5b/JRR_Tolkien_signature_-_from_Commons.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Oxford_Tolkien.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Merton_College_and_chapel_from_St_Marys.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Quenya_Example.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Tolkien%27s_Plough_and_Harrow_blue_plaque.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Sound-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Tolkien%27s_grave%2C_Wolvercote_Cemetery.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Tolkien%27s_Sarehole_Mill_blue_plaque-persp.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Mabel_Suffield_Christmas_Card.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/BirminghamOratoryDome.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/En-JRRTolkien.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Eagle_and_Child_%28interior%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/20_Northmoor_Road%2C_Oxford.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Arda.Tengwar.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/2_Darnley_Road%2C_the_former_home_of_J.R.R._Tolkien_in_West_Park%2C_Leeds.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Tolkien_1916.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/KES_Free_Grammar_School_Charles_Barry.jpg"]	f	cover
451	Arthur C. Clarke	Sir Arthur Charles Clarke, CBE, FRAS (Sri Lankabhimanya Arthur Charles Clarke) (16 December 1917 – 19 March 2008) was a British science fiction writer, science writer, inventor, undersea explorer, and television series host.\nHe is perhaps most famous for being co-writer of the screenplay for the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey, considered by the American Film Institute to be one of the most influential films of all time. His other science fiction writings earned him a number of Hugo and Nebula awards, along with a large readership, making him into one of the towering figures of the field. For many years he, along with Robert Heinlein and Isaac Asimov, were known as the "Big Three" of science fiction.\nClarke was a lifelong proponent of space travel. In 1934 while still a teenager, he joined the British Interplanetary Society. In 1945, he proposed a satellite communication system—an idea that, in 1963, won him the Franklin Institute's Stuart Ballantine Medal. Later he was the chairman of the British Interplanetary Society from 1946–47 and again in 1951-53.\nClarke was also a science writer, who was both an avid popularizer of space travel and a futurist of uncanny ability, who won a Kalinga Prize (award given by Unesco for popularizing science) in 1961. These all together eventually earned him the moniker "prophet of the space age".\nClarke emigrated to Sri Lanka in 1956, largely to pursue his interest in scuba diving.

503	American Enlightenment	The American Enlightenment is a period of intellectual ferment in the thirteen American colonies in the period 1714–1818, which led to the American Revolution, American Independence, the creation of the American Republic under the United States Constitution of 1787, the Bill of Rights in 1790, the development of Federal and State laws and institutions, the liberties defined in the constitution over the next three decades, and the War of 1812 or "Second War of Independence". Influenced by the 18th-century European Enlightenment, and its own native American Philosophy, the American Enlightenment applied scientific reasoning to politics, science, and religion, promoted religious tolerance, and restored literature, the arts, and music as important disciplines and professions worthy of study in colleges. The "new-model" American style colleges of King's College New York (now Columbia University), and the College of Philadelphia (now Penn) were founded, Yale College and the College of William & Mary were reformed, and a non-denominational moral philosophy replaced theology in many college curricula; even Puritan colleges such as the College of New Jersey (now Princeton) and Harvard reformed their curricula to include natural philosophy (science), modern astronomy, and math. The foremost representatives of the American Enlightenment included men who were Presidents of Colonial Colleges: Puritan religious leaders President Jonathan Edwards, President Thomas Clap, and President Ezra Stiles, and Anglican moral philosophers American President Samuel Johnson and Provost William Smith. It also included political thinkers John Adams, James Madison, James Wilson, and Alexander Hamilton, and polymaths Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson.	\N	\N	\N	http://lib.stanford.edu/files/u4/HancockMFABostonDetail.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Enlightenment	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Office-book.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Thomas_Paine.jpg"]	f	cover
27	Michelangelo	Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni (6 March 1475 – 18 February 1564), commonly known as Michelangelo (Italian pronunciation: [mikeˈlandʒelo]), was an Italian sculptor, painter, architect, poet, and engineer of the High Renaissance who exerted an unparalleled influence on the development of Western art. Despite making few forays beyond the arts, his versatility in the disciplines he took up was of such a high order that he is often considered a contender for the title of the archetypal Renaissance man, along with his fellow Italian Leonardo da Vinci.\nMichelangelo was considered the greatest living artist in his lifetime, and ever since then he has been held to be one of the greatest artists of all time. A number of his works in painting, sculpture, and architecture rank among the most famous in existence. His output in every field during his long life was prodigious; when the sheer volume of correspondence, sketches, and reminiscences that survive is also taken into account, he is the best-documented artist of the 16th century.\nTwo of his best-known works, the Pietà and David, were sculpted before he turned thirty. Despite his low opinion of painting, Michelangelo also created two of the most influential works in fresco in the history of Western art: the scenes from Genesis on the ceiling and The Last Judgment on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel in Rome. As an architect, Michelangelo pioneered the Mannerist style at the Laurentian Library. At the age of 74 he succeeded Antonio da Sangallo the Younger as the architect of St. Peter's Basilica. Michelangelo transformed the plan, the western end being finished to Michelangelo's design, the dome being completed after his death with some modification.\nIn a demonstration of Michelangelo's unique standing, he was the first Western artist whose biography was published while he was alive. Two biographies were published of him during his lifetime; one of them, by Giorgio Vasari, proposed that he was the pinnacle of all artistic achievement since the beginning of the Renaissance, a viewpoint that continued to have currency in art history for centuries.\nIn his lifetime he was also often called Il Divino ("the divine one"). One of the qualities most admired by his contemporaries was his terribilità, a sense of awe-inspiring grandeur, and it was the attempts of subsequent artists to imitate Michelangelo's impassioned and highly personal style that resulted in Mannerism, the next major movement in Western art after the High Renaissance.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/03/Flag_of_Italy.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/WPVA-khamsa.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Vatican-ChapelleSixtine-Plafond.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Michelangelo_Bacchus.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Michelangelo_Buonarroti_027.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Michelangelo%2C_ignudo_18.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Michelangelo%2C_paolina%2C_martirio_di_san_pietro_01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Michelangelo-_Tondo_Doni_-_tone_corrected.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Michelangelo_-_Atlas.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Michelangelo%2C_Deluge_02.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Michelangelo%2C_centauromachia%2C_1492_ca._01_crop.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Michelangelo%2C_giudizio_universale%2C_dettagli_33.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Michelangelo%2C_ignudo_01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Ivresse_de_noe.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/First_Day_of_Creation.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Last_Judgement_by_Michelangelo.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/La_batalla_de_Cascina_-_Sangallo.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/L%E2%80%99Architecture_de_la_Renaissance_-_Fig._13.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Laurentian_Library_vestibule.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Michaelangelo_Moses.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Madonna_michelangelo1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Michelangelo%27s_grave4.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Michelangelo%27s_Pieta_5450_cut_out_black.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/CampidoglioEng.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Taddei_Tondo.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Piet%C3%A0_per_Vittoria_Colonna.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Ortographia_Partis_Exterioris_Templi_Divi_Petri_in_Vaticano.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Office-book.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Michelango_Portrait_by_Volterra.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Michelangelo_the_libyan.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Michelangelo_piet%C3%A0_rondanini.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Michelangelo_libyan.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Michelangelo_Pieta_Firenze.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/C_o_a_popes_Della_Rovere.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/CAPPELLA_SISTINA_Ceiling.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/David_von_Michelangelo.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/Creaci%C3%B3n_de_Ad%C3%A1m.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Angel_by_Michelangelo_-_3.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Buonarotti-scala.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Basilique_Saint-Pierre_Vatican_dome.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Firenze.Palvecchio.500.Michelangelo2.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Dying_slave_Louvre_MR_1590.jpg"]	f	cover
67	Old English	Old English (Ænglisc, Anglisc, Englisc) or Anglo-Saxon is an early form of the English language that was spoken and written by the Anglo-Saxons and their descendants in parts of what are now England and southern and eastern Scotland between at least the mid-5th century and the mid-12th century. What survives through writing represents primarily the literary register of Anglo-Saxon.\nIt is a West Germanic language closely related to Old Frisian and Old Saxon. Old English had a grammar similar in many ways to Classical Latin. In most respects, including its grammar, it was much closer to modern German and Icelandic than to modern English. It was fully inflected with five grammatical cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, and instrumental), three grammatical numbers (singular, plural, and dual) and three grammatical genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter). The dual forms occurred in the first and second persons only and referred to groups of two.\nAdjectives, pronouns and (sometimes) participles agreed with their antecedent nouns in case, number and gender. Finite verbs agreed with their subject in person and number.\nNouns came in numerous declensions (with deep parallels in Latin, Ancient Greek and Sanskrit). Verbs came in nine main conjugations (seven strong and two weak), each with numerous subtypes, as well as a few additional smaller conjugations and a handful of irregular verbs. The main difference from other ancient Indo-European languages, such as Latin, is that verbs can be conjugated in only two tenses (vs. the six "tenses" – really tense/aspect combinations – of Latin), and have no synthetic passive voice (although it did still exist in Gothic).\nGender in nouns was grammatical, as opposed to the natural gender that prevails in modern English. That is, the grammatical gender of a given noun did not necessarily correspond to its natural gender, even for nouns referring to people. For example, sēo sunne (the Sun) was feminine, se mōna (the Moon) was masculine, and þat wīf "the woman/wife" was neuter. (Compare German cognates die Sonne, der Mond, das Weib.) Pronominal usage could reflect either natural or grammatical gender, when it conflicted.\nFrom the 9th century, Old English experienced heavy influence from Old Norse, a member of the related North Germanic group of languages.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/80/Wikipedia-logo-v2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Old_norse%2C_ca_900.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Germanic_dialects_ca._AD_1.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Peterborough_Chronicle_cropped.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Anglosaxonrunes.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Beowulf_cropped.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg"]	f	cover
455	Elizabeth I of England	Elizabeth I (7 September 1533 – 24 March 1603) was queen regnant of England and Ireland from 17 November 1558 until her death. Sometimes called "The Virgin Queen", "Gloriana" or "Good Queen Bess", Elizabeth was the fifth and last monarch of the Tudor dynasty. The daughter of Henry VIII, she was born into the royal succession, but her mother, Anne Boleyn, was executed two and a half years after her birth, with Anne's marriage to Henry VIII being annulled, and Elizabeth hence declared illegitimate. Her half-brother, Edward VI, ruled as king until his death in 1553, whereupon he bequeathed the crown to Lady Jane Grey, cutting his two half-sisters, Elizabeth and the Roman Catholic Mary, out of the succession in spite of statute law to the contrary. His will was set aside, Mary became queen, and Lady Jane Grey was executed. In 1558, Elizabeth succeeded her half-sister, during whose reign she had been imprisoned for nearly a year on suspicion of supporting Protestant rebels.\nElizabeth set out to rule by good counsel, and she depended heavily on a group of trusted advisers led by William Cecil, Baron Burghley. One of her first moves as queen was the establishment of an English Protestant church, of which she became the Supreme Governor. This Elizabethan Religious Settlement later evolved into today's Church of England. It was expected that Elizabeth would marry and produce an heir so as to continue the Tudor line. She never did, however, despite numerous courtships. As she grew older, Elizabeth became famous for her virginity, and a cult grew up around her which was celebrated in the portraits, pageants, and literature of the day.\nIn government, Elizabeth was more moderate than her father and half-siblings had been. One of her mottoes was "video et taceo" ("I see, and say nothing"). In religion she was relatively tolerant, avoiding systematic persecution. After 1570, when the pope declared her illegitimate and released her subjects from obedience to her, several conspiracies threatened her life. All plots were defeated, however, with the help of her ministers' secret service. Elizabeth was cautious in foreign affairs, moving between the major powers of France and Spain. She only half-heartedly supported a number of ineffective, poorly resourced military campaigns in the Netherlands, France, and Ireland. In the mid-1580s, war with Spain could no longer be avoided, and when Spain finally decided to attempt to conquer England in 1588, the failure of the Spanish Armada associated her with one of the greatest military victories in English history.\nElizabeth's reign is known as the Elizabethan era, famous above all for the flourishing of English drama, led by playwrights such as William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe, and for the seafaring prowess of English adventurers such as Francis Drake. Some historians are more reserved in their assessment. They depict Elizabeth as a short-tempered, sometimes indecisive ruler, who enjoyed more than her share of luck. Towards the end of her reign, a series of economic and military problems weakened her popularity. Elizabeth is acknowledged as a charismatic performer and a dogged survivor, in an age when government was ramshackle and limited and when monarchs in neighbouring countries faced internal problems that jeopardised their thrones. Such was the case with Elizabeth's rival, Mary, Queen of Scots, whom she imprisoned in 1568 and eventually had executed in 1587. After the short reigns of Elizabeth's half-siblings, her 44 years on the throne provided welcome stability for the kingdom and helped forge a sense of national identity.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Elizabeth_I_%28Armada_Portrait%29.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Elizabeth_I_Rainbow_Portrait.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Ivan_the_Terrible_and_Harsey.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Darnley_stage_3.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Nicholas_Hilliard_002.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Sir_Francis_Walsingham_by_John_De_Critz_the_Elder.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Elizabeth_I_Steven_Van_Der_Meulen.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Elizabeth_I_%28Armada_Portrait%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Elizabeth_I_portrait%2C_Marcus_Gheeraerts_the_Younger_c.1595.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Elizabeth_I_in_coronation_robes.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Elizabeth_and_Leicester_miniatures_by_Hilliard.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Elizabeth_I_when_a_Princess.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Funeral_Elisabeth.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Embroidered_bookbinding_Elizabeth_I.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Henry_VIII_and_Anne_Boleyn.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Hatfield_House_Old_Palace.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/MoorishAmbassador_to_Elizabeth_I.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Mary_I_of_England.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Coat_of_Arms_of_England_%281558-1603%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Canterbury_Cathedral%2C_view_of_the_Western_Towers_engraved_by_J.LeKeux_after_a_picture_by_G.Cattermole%2C_1821_edited.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Elizabeth_I_when_a_Princess.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Devereaux_essex4.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/20131018QueenBessGraveL%28crop2%29.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Autograph_of_Elizabeth_I_of_England.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Anglican_rose.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Elizabeth_I_Halfgroat.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Elizabeth-I-Allegorical-Po.jpg"]	f	70%
10	Johannes Gutenberg	Johannes Gensfleisch zur Laden zum Gutenberg (/joʊˌhɑːnɨs ˈɡuːtənbɜrɡ/ yoh-HAH-nəs GOO-tən-burɡ; c. 1395 – February 3, 1468) was a German blacksmith, goldsmith, printer, and publisher who introduced printing to Europe. His invention of mechanical movable type printing started the Printing Revolution and is widely regarded as the most important event of the modern period. It played a key role in the development of the Renaissance, Reformation, the Age of Enlightenment, and the Scientific Revolution and laid the material basis for the modern knowledge-based economy and the spread of learning to the masses.\nGutenberg was the first European to use movable type printing, in around 1439. Among his many contributions to printing are: the invention of a process for mass-producing movable type; the use of oil-based ink; and the use of a wooden printing press similar to the agricultural screw presses of the period. His truly epochal invention was the combination of these elements into a practical system which allowed the mass production of printed books and was economically viable for printers and readers alike. Gutenberg's method for making type is traditionally considered to have included a type metal alloy and a hand mould for casting type.\nIn Renaissance Europe, the arrival of mechanical movable type printing introduced the era of mass communication which permanently altered the structure of society. The relatively unrestricted circulation of information — including revolutionary ideas — transcended borders, captured the masses in the Reformation and threatened the power of political and religious authorities; the sharp increase in literacy broke the monopoly of the literate elite on education and learning and bolstered the emerging middle class. Across Europe, the increasing cultural self-awareness of its people led to the rise of proto-nationalism, accelerated by the flowering of the European vernacular languages to the detriment of Latin's status as lingua franca. In the 19th century, the replacement of the hand-operated Gutenberg-style press by steam-powered rotary presses allowed printing on an industrial scale, while Western-style printing was adopted all over the world, becoming practically the sole medium for modern bulk printing.\nThe use of movable type was a marked improvement on the handwritten manuscript, which was the existing method of book production in Europe, and upon woodblock printing, and revolutionized European book-making. Gutenberg's printing technology spread rapidly throughout Europe and later the world.\nHis major work, the Gutenberg Bible (also known as the 42-line Bible), has been acclaimed for its high aesthetic and technical quality.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Featherbed_Alley_Printshop_Bermuda.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Metal_movable_type.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Featherbed_Alley_Printshop_Bermuda.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Johannes_Gutenberg.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Gutenberg_Bible.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Printer_in_1568-ce.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/95Thesen.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Gutenberg.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/European_Output_of_Printed_Books_ca._1450%E2%80%931800.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Printing3_Walk_of_Ideas_Berlin.JPG"]	f	cover
61	Desiderius Erasmus	Desiderius Erasmus Roterodamus (27 October 1466 – 12 July 1536), known as Erasmus of Rotterdam, or simply Erasmus, was a Dutch Renaissance humanist, Catholic priest, social critic, teacher, and theologian.\nErasmus was a classical scholar who wrote in a pure Latin style. Amongst humanists, he enjoyed the sobriquet "Prince of the Humanists"; he has been called "the crowning glory of the Christian humanists". Using humanist techniques for working on texts, he prepared important new Latin and Greek editions of the New Testament. These raised questions that would be influential in the Protestant Reformation and Catholic Counter-Reformation. He also wrote On Free Will, The Praise of Folly, Handbook of a Christian Knight, On Civility in Children, Copia: Foundations of the Abundant Style, Julius Exclusus, and many other works.\nErasmus lived against the backdrop of the growing European religious Reformation; but while he was critical of the abuses within the Church and called for reform, he kept his distance from Luther and Melanchthon and continued to recognise the authority of the pope. Erasmus emphasized a middle way, with a deep respect for traditional faith, piety and grace, and rejected Luther's emphasis on faith alone. Erasmus therefore remained a member of the Catholic Church all his life. Erasmus remained committed to reforming the Church and its clerics' abuses from within. He also held to Catholic doctrines such as that of free will, which some Reformers rejected in favour of the doctrine of predestination. His middle road approach disappointed and even angered scholars in both camps.\nErasmus died suddenly in Basel in 1536 while preparing to return to Brabant, and was buried in the Basel Minster, the former cathedral of the city. A bronze statue of him was erected in his city of birth in 1622, replacing an earlier work in stone.\nErasmus was his baptismal name, given after St. Erasmus of Formiae. Desiderius was a self-adopted additional name, which he used from 1496. The Roterodamus in his scholarly name is the Latinized adjectival form for the city of Rotterdam.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Erasmus_rotterdam.JPG	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desiderius_Erasmus	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Martin_Luther_by_Lucas_Cranach_der_%C3%84ltere.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/HolbeinErasmusHands.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Erasmus_hieronymus.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Erasmus_censored.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Hans_Holbein_d._J._047.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Erasmus_rotterdam.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Erasmus%28buste%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Rotterdam_standbeeld_Erasmus.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Erasmus_Duerer_VandA_E.4621-1910.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Erasmus-schedel.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/HolbeinErasmusFollymarginalia.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Holbein-erasmus.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg"]	f	80%
450	Isaac Asimov	Isaac Asimov (/ˈaɪzɨk ˈæzɨmɒv/ EYE-zək AZ-ə-mov; born Isaak Yudovich Ozimov; circa January 2, 1920 – April 6, 1992) was an American author and professor of biochemistry at Boston University, best known for his works of science fiction and for his popular science books. Asimov was one of the most prolific writers of all time, having written or edited more than 500 books and an estimated 90,000 letters and postcards. His books have been published in 9 of the 10 major categories of the Dewey Decimal Classification.\nAsimov is widely considered a master of hard science fiction and, along with Robert A. Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke, he was considered one of the "Big Three" science fiction writers during his lifetime. Asimov's most famous work is the Foundation Series; his other major series are the Galactic Empire series and the Robot series. The Galactic Empire novels are explicitly set in earlier history of the same fictional universe as the Foundation series. Later, beginning with Foundation's Edge, he linked this distant future to the Robot and Spacer stories, creating a unified "future history" for his stories much like those pioneered by Robert A. Heinlein and previously produced by Cordwainer Smith and Poul Anderson. He wrote hundreds of short stories, including the social science fiction "Nightfall", which in 1964 was voted by the Science Fiction Writers of America the best short science fiction story of all time. Asimov wrote the Lucky Starr series of juvenile science-fiction novels using the pen name Paul French.\nThe prolific Asimov also wrote mysteries and fantasy, as well as much nonfiction. Most of his popular science books explain scientific concepts in a historical way, going as far back as possible to a time when the science in question was at its simplest stage. He often provides nationalities, birth dates, and death dates for the scientists he mentions, as well as etymologies and pronunciation guides for technical terms. Examples include Guide to Science, the three-volume set Understanding Physics, and Asimov's Chronology of Science and Discovery, as well as works on astronomy, mathematics, the Bible, William Shakespeare's writing, and chemistry.\nAsimov was a long-time member and vice president of Mensa International, albeit reluctantly; he described some members of that organization as "brain-proud and aggressive about their IQs". He took more joy in being president of the American Humanist Association. The asteroid 5020 Asimov, a crater on the planet Mars, a Brooklyn, New York elementary school, and a literary award are named in his honor.\n\n	\N	\N	\N	http://www.notablebiographies.com/images/uewb_01_img0047.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Heinlein-decamp-and-asimov.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Isaac.Asimov01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Isaac_Asimov_signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Isaac_Asimov_on_Throne.png"]	f	60%
78	Presbyterianism	Presbyterianism is a branch of Reformed Protestantism which traces its origins to the British Isles. Presbyterian churches derive their name from the presbyterian form of church government, which is government by representative assemblies of elders. Many Reformed churches are organized this way, but the word "Presbyterian," when capitalized, is often applied uniquely to the churches which trace their roots to the Scottish and English churches that bore that name and English political groups that formed during the Civil War. Presbyterian theology typically emphasizes the sovereignty of God, the authority of the Scriptures, and the necessity of grace through faith in Christ. Presbyterian church government was ensured in Scotland by the Acts of Union in 1707 which created the kingdom of Great Britain. In fact, most Presbyterians found in England can trace a Scottish connection, and the Presbyterian denomination was also taken to North America mostly by Scots and Scots-Irish immigrants. The Presbyterian denominations in Scotland hold to the theology of John Calvin and his immediate successors, although there is a range of theological views within contemporary Presbyterianism.\nLocal congregations of churches which use presbyterian polity are governed by sessions made up of representatives of the congregation (elders); a conciliar approach which is found at other levels of decision-making (presbytery, synod and general assembly).\nThe roots of Presbyterianism lie in the European Reformation of the 16th century, with the example of John Calvin's Geneva being particularly influential. Most Reformed churches who trace their history back to Scotland are either presbyterian or congregationalist in government. In the twentieth century, some Presbyterians played an important role in the Ecumenical Movement, including the World Council of Churches. Many Presbyterian denominations have found ways of working together with other Reformed denominations and Christians of other traditions, especially in the World Communion of Reformed Churches. Some Presbyterian churches have entered into unions with other churches, such as Congregationalists, Lutherans, Anglicans, and Methodists.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterianism	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Presbyterian_Family_Connections.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Kreuz-hugenotten.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/USVA_headstone_emb-04.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Timeline_of_Aust._Pres._Denominations.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Burning-Bush-1.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/John_Knox_woodcut.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Catedral_Presbiteriana%2C_Rio_de_Janeiro.jpg"]	f	cover
86	Blitum bonus-henricus	Good King Henry (Blitum bonus-henricus, Syn. Chenopodium bonus-henricus), also called Poor-man's Asparagus, Perennial Goosefoot, Lincolnshire Spinach or Markery is a species of goosefoot which is native to much of central and southern Europe.\nGood King Henry has been grown as a vegetable in cottage gardens for hundreds of years, although this dual-purpose vegetable is now rarely grown and the species is more often considered a weed.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitum_bonus-henricus	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Wikispecies-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Illustration_Chenopodium_bonus-henricus0.jpg"]	f	cover
184	Capitalism	Capitalism is an economic system in which trade, industry and the means of production are controlled by private owners with the goal of making profits in a market economy. Central characteristics of capitalism include capital accumulation, competitive markets and wage labor. In a capitalist economy, the parties to a transaction typically determine the prices at which assets, goods, and services are exchanged.\nThe degree of competition, role of intervention and regulation, and scope of public ownership varies across different models of capitalism. Economists, political economists, and historians have taken different perspectives in their analysis of capitalism and recognized various forms of it in practice. These include laissez-faire capitalism, welfare capitalism and state capitalism; each highlighting varying degrees of dependency on markets, public ownership, and inclusion of social policies. The extent to which different markets are free, as well as the rules defining private property, is a matter of politics and policy. Many states have what are termed capitalist mixed economies, referring to a mix between planned and market-driven elements. Crony capitalism, is a state of affairs in which insider corruption, nepotism and cartels dominate the system. In Marxian economics this is considered to be the normal state of mature capitalism, while in anarcho-capitalist theory it is considered a political distortion of capital and markets.\nCapitalism has existed under many forms of government, in many different times, places, and cultures. Following the demise of feudalism, capitalism became the dominant economic system in the Western world. Later, in the 20th century, capitalism overcame a challenge by centrally-planned economies and is now the dominant system worldwide, with the mixed economy being its dominant form in the industrialized Western world.\nDifferent economic perspectives emphasize specific elements of capitalism in their preferred definition. Laissez-faire and liberal economists emphasize the degree to which government does not have control over markets and the importance of property rights. Neoclassical and Keynesian macro-economists emphasize the need for government regulation to prevent monopolies and to soften the effects of the boom and bust cycle. Marxian economists emphasize the role of capital accumulation, exploitation and wage labor. Most political economists emphasize private property as well, in addition to power relations, wage labor, class, and the uniqueness of capitalism as a historical formation.\nProponents of capitalism argue that it creates more prosperity than any other economic system, and that its benefits are mainly to the ordinary person. Critics of capitalism variously associate it with economic instability and an inability to provide for the well-being of all people. In contrast to both perspectives, socialists maintain that capitalism is superior to all previously existing economic systems (such as feudalism or slavery) but that the contradiction between class interests will only be resolved by advancing into a completely social system of production and distribution in which all persons have an equal relationship to the means of production.\nThe term capitalism, in its modern sense, is often attributed to Karl Marx. In his magnum opus Capital, Marx analysed the "capitalist mode of production" using a method of understanding today known as Marxism. However, Marx himself rarely used the term "capitalism", while it was used twice in the more political interpretations of his work, primarily authored by his collaborator Friedrich Engels. In the 20th century defenders of the capitalist system often replaced the term capitalism with phrases such as free enterprise and private enterprise and replaced capitalist with rentier and investor in reaction to the negative connotations associated with capitalism.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/McKinley_Prosperity.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Maquina_vapor_Watt_ETSIIM.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Ludwig_von_Mises.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/NY_stock_exchange_traders_floor_LC-U9-10548-6.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Max_Weber_1917.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Prc1952-2005gdp.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Clive.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Supply-and-demand.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Smith.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Veblen3a.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/McKinley_Prosperity.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Factory_1b.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Emblem-money.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/John_Maynard_Keynes.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Gdp_chart.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Economic_template.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Anti-capitalism_color.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Lorrain.seaport.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Karl_Marx.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Portrait_of_Milton_Friedman.jpg"]	f	cover
96	William the Silent	William I, Prince of Orange (24 April 1533 – 10 July 1584), also widely known as William the Silent (Dutch: Willem de Zwijger), or more commonly known as William of Orange (Dutch: Willem van Oranje), was the main leader of the Dutch revolt against the Spanish that set off the Eighty Years' War and resulted in the formal independence of the United Provinces in 1648. He was born in the House of Nassau as Count of Nassau-Dillenburg. He became Prince of Orange in 1544 and is thereby the founder of the branch House of Orange-Nassau and the ancestor of the monarchy of the Netherlands.\nA wealthy nobleman, William originally served the Habsburgs as a member of the court of Margaret of Parma, governor of the Spanish Netherlands. Unhappy with the centralisation of political power away from the local estates and with the Spanish persecution of Dutch Protestants, William joined the Dutch uprising and turned against his former masters. The most influential and politically capable of the rebels, he led the Dutch to several successes in the fight against the Spanish. Declared an outlaw by the Spanish king in 1580, he was assassinated by Balthasar Gérard (also written as "Gerardts") in Delft in 1584.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_the_Silent	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Louisecoligny.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Willem_van_Oranje_wapen.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/KogelgatenPrinsenhof.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/WilliamOfOrange1580.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Willem_van_Oranje_Standbeeld_Den_Haag%2C_juni_2003.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Philip_II_of_Spain_berating_William_the_Silent_Prince_of_Orange_by_Cornelis_Kruseman.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Blason_Nassau-Orange.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Arms_Nassau.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Charlottebourbon.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Blason_Nassau-Orange_%28Cadets%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Anna_von_Egmond.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Nicholas_Hilliard_002.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Antonio_Moro_-_Willem_I_van_Nassau.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Annasaxony1544.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/William_the_Silent-Coat_of_arms.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Frederik_Hendrik_by_Michiel_Jansz_van_Mierevelt.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Dillenburg_1575.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Prinsenvlag.svg"]	f	cover
142	Antonio Vivaldi	Antonio Lucio Vivaldi (Italian: [anˈtɔːnjo ˈluːtʃo viˈvaldi]; 4 March 1678 – 28 July 1741), nicknamed il Prete Rosso ("The Red Priest") because of his red hair, was an Italian Baroque composer, Catholic priest, and virtuoso violinist, born in Venice. Recognized as one of the greatest Baroque composers, his influence during his lifetime was widespread over Europe. Vivaldi is known mainly for composing instrumental concertos, especially for the violin, as well as sacred choral works and over forty operas. His best known work is a series of violin concertos known as The Four Seasons.\nMany of his compositions were written for the female music ensemble of the Ospedale della Pietà, a home for abandoned children where Vivaldi had been employed from 1703 to 1715 and from 1723 to 1740. Vivaldi also had some success with stagings of his operas in Venice, Mantua and Vienna. After meeting the Emperor Charles VI, Vivaldi moved to Vienna, hoping for preferment. However, the Emperor died soon after Vivaldi's arrival and Vivaldi himself died less than a year later.\nThough Vivaldi's music was well received during his lifetime, it later declined in popularity until its vigorous revival in the first half of the 20th century. Today, Vivaldi ranks among the most popular and widely recorded of Baroque composers, second only to Johann Sebastian Bach.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Vivaldi	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/01_-_Vivaldi_Spring_mvt_1_Allegro_-_John_Harrison_violin.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Vivaldi_caricature.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Teatro_alla_moda.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Vivaldis_first_edition_of_Juditha_triumphnas.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Antonio_Vivaldi.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Gnome-mime-audio-openclipart.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Chiesa_di_San_Giovanni_in_Bragora_-_Venezia.jpg"]	f	cover
111	Gian Lorenzo Bernini	Gian Lorenzo Bernini (also spelled Gianlorenzo or Giovanni Lorenzo) (Naples, 7 December 1598 – Rome, 28 November 1680) was an Italian artist and a prominent architect who worked principally in Rome. He was the leading sculptor of his age, credited with creating the Baroque style of sculpture. In addition, he painted, wrote plays, and designed metalwork and stage sets.\nBernini possessed the ability to depict dramatic narratives with characters showing intense psychological states, but also organise large-scale sculptural works which convey a magnificent grandeur. His skill in manipulating marble ensured he was considered a worthy successor of Michelangelo, far outshining other sculptors of his generation, including his rival, Alessandro Algardi. His talent extended beyond the confines of his sculpture to consideration of the setting in which it would be situated; his ability to synthesise sculpture, painting and architecture into a coherent conceptual and visual whole has been termed by the art historian Irving Lavin the "unity of the visual arts". A deeply religious man, working in Counter Reformation Rome, Bernini used light as an important metaphorical device in the perception of his religious settings, often using hidden light sources that could intensify the focus of religious worship, or enhance the dramatic moment of a sculptural narrative.\nBernini was also a leading figure in the emergence of Roman Baroque architecture along with his contemporaries, the architect, Francesco Borromini and the painter and architect, Pietro da Cortona. Early in their careers they had all worked at the same time at the Palazzo Barberini, initially under Carlo Maderno and on his death, under Bernini. Later on, however, they were in competition for commissions and fierce rivalries developed, particularly between Bernini and Borromini. Despite the arguably greater architectural inventiveness of Borromini and Cortona, Bernini's artistic pre-eminence, particularly during the reigns of popes Urban VIII (1623–44) and Alexander VII (1655–65), meant he was able to secure the most important commission in the Rome of his day, St. Peter's Basilica. His design of the Piazza San Pietro in front of the Basilica is one of his most innovative and successful architectural designs.\nDuring his long career, Bernini received numerous important commissions, many of which were associated with the papacy. At an early age, he came to the attention of the papal nephew, Cardinal Scipione Borghese, and in 1621, at the age of only 23, he was knighted by Pope Gregory XV. Following his accession to the papacy, Urban VIII is reported to have said, "Your luck is great to see Cardinal Maffeo Barberini Pope, Cavaliere; but ours is much greater to have Cavalier Bernini alive in our pontificate." Although he did not fare so well during the reign of Innocent X, under Alexander VII, he once again regained pre-eminent artistic domination and continued to be held in high regard by Clement IX.\nBernini and other artists fell from favour in later neoclassical criticism of the Baroque. It is only from the late 19th century that art historical scholarship, in seeking an understanding of artistic output in the cultural context in which it was produced, has come to recognise Bernini's achievements and restore his artistic reputation. The art historian Howard Hibbard concludes that during the seventeenth century "there were no sculptors or architects comparable to Bernini."	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gian_Lorenzo_Bernini	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b3/The_Rape_of_Proserpina_1_-_Bernini_-_1622_-_Galleria_Borghese%2C_Rome.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/St._Peter%27s_Square_3.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/Teresa_von_Avila_Bernini1.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Vatican_Altar_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/St_Peter%27s_Square%2C_Vatican_City_-_April_2007.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Gianlorenzo_Bernini_by_Giovanni_Battista_Gaulli_%28National_Galleries_of_Scotland%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Gianlorenzo_Bernini_-_Self-Portrait_-_WGA01973.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Magnify-clip.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Lazio_Roma_Navona2_tango7174.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Richelieu_le_Bernin_M.R.2165_mp3h9006.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Ponte_St._Angelo.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Rome_basilica_st_peter_002.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Rome_Fontana_dei_Quattro_Fiume_10-01-2011_11-54-14.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Santa_teresa_di_bernini_04.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/San_pietro%2C_baldacchino.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Gian_Lorenzo_Bernini%2C_self-portrait%2C_c1623.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Blessed_Ludovica_Albertoni_by_Gian_Lorenzo_Bernini.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Berninigrave.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Bust_of_Pope_Urban_VIII_by_Bernini.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Blessed_Soul_by_Bernini.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/ApolloAndDaphne.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Bernini_-_Damned_Soul.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Baldachin_petersdom.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Gian_lorenzo_bernini%2C_ritratto_di_antonio_cepparelli%2C_1622%2C_museo_di_san_giovanni_dei_fiorentini.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Versailles%2C_salon_de_Diane%2C_buste_de_Louis_XIV%2C_Bernin_%281665%29_03_black_bg.jpg"]	f	cover
113	Caravaggio	Michelangelo Merisi (or Amerighi) da Caravaggio (Italian pronunciation: [karaˈvaddʒo]; 29 September 1571? – 18 July? 1610) was an Italian artist active in Rome, Naples, Malta, and Sicily between 1592 (1595?) and 1610. His paintings, which combine a realistic observation of the human state, both physical and emotional, with a dramatic use of lighting, had a formative influence on Baroque painting.\nCaravaggio trained as a painter in Milan under Simone Peterzano who had himself trained under Titian. In his twenties Caravaggio moved to Rome where, during the late 16th and early 17th centuries, many huge new churches and palazzos were being built and paintings were needed to fill them. During the Counter-Reformation, the Roman Catholic Church searched for religious art with which to counter the threat of Protestantism, and for this task the artificial conventions of Mannerism, which had ruled art production for some time after the Renaissance, no longer seemed adequate.\nCaravaggio's novelty was a radical naturalism that combined close physical observation with a dramatic, even theatrical, use of chiaroscuro. This came to be known as Tenebrism, the shift from light to dark with little intermediate value. He burst upon the Rome art scene in 1600 with the success of his first public commissions, the Martyrdom of Saint Matthew and Calling of Saint Matthew. Thereafter he never lacked commissions or patrons, yet he handled his success poorly. He was jailed on several occasions, vandalized his own apartment, and ultimately had a death warrant issued for him by the Pope.\nAn early published notice on him, dating from 1604 and describing his lifestyle three years previously, tells how "after a fortnight's work he will swagger about for a month or two with a sword at his side and a servant following him, from one ball-court to the next, ever ready to engage in a fight or an argument, so that it is most awkward to get along with him." In 1606 he killed a young man in a brawl and fled from Rome with a price on his head. He was involved in a brawl in Malta in 1608, and another in Naples in 1609, possibly a deliberate attempt on his life by unidentified enemies. This encounter left him severely injured. A year later, at the age of 38, he died under mysterious circumstances in Porto Ercole, reportedly from a fever while on his way to Rome to receive a pardon.\nFamous while he lived, Caravaggio was forgotten almost immediately after his death, and it was only in the 20th century that his importance to the development of Western art was rediscovered. Despite this, his influence on the new Baroque style that eventually emerged from the ruins of Mannerism was profound. It can be seen directly or indirectly in the work of Rubens, Jusepe de Ribera, Bernini, and Rembrandt, and artists in the following generation heavily under his influence were called the "Caravaggisti" or "Caravagesques", as well as Tenebrists or "Tenebrosi" ("shadowists"). Art historian Andre Berne-Joffroy said of him: "What begins in the work of Caravaggio is, quite simply, modern painting."	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caravaggio	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Caravaggio_-_Martirio_di_San_Pietro.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Death_of_the_Virgin-Caravaggio_%281606%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Caravaggio_-_La_Deposizione_di_Cristo.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Michelangelo_Merisi_da_Caravaggio_-_Nativity_with_St_Francis_and_St_Lawrence_-_WGA04193.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Conversion_on_the_Way_to_Damascus-Caravaggio_%28c.1600-1%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/The_Denial_of_Saint_Peter-Caravaggio_%281610%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Caravaggio_-_Sette_opere_di_Misericordia.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Caravaggio%2C_Michelangelo_Merisi_da_-_The_Calling_of_Saint_Matthew_-_1599-1600_%28hi_res%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Canestra_di_frutta_%28Caravaggio%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Caravaggio_-_Cena_in_Emmaus.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/CaravaggioSalomeMadrid.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Amor_Vincet_Omnia.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/Caravaggio_-_San_Gerolamo.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Boy_with_a_Basket_of_Fruit-Caravaggio_%281593%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Bild-Ottavio_Leoni%2C_Caravaggio.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Orazio_Gentileschi_-_Young_Woman_Playing_a_Violin.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Caravaggio_Judith_Beheading_Holofernes.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Caravaggio_-_I_Musici.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Caravaggio_-_David_con_la_testa_di_Golia.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Caravaggio_-_Taking_of_Christ_-_Dublin.jpg"]	f	cover
117	Rembrandt	Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn (Dutch: [ˈrɛmbrɑnt ˈɦɑrmə(n)soːn vɑn ˈrɛin] ( ); 15 July 1606 – 4 October 1669) was a Dutch painter and etcher. He is generally considered one of the greatest painters and printmakers in European art and the most important in Dutch history. His contributions to art came in a period of great wealth and cultural achievement that historians call the Dutch Golden Age when Dutch Golden Age painting, although in many ways antithetical to the Baroque style that dominated Europe, was extremely prolific and innovative.\nHaving achieved youthful success as a portrait painter, Rembrandt's later years were marked by personal tragedy and financial hardships. Yet his etchings and paintings were popular throughout his lifetime, his reputation as an artist remained high, and for twenty years he taught many important Dutch painters. Rembrandt's greatest creative triumphs are exemplified especially in his portraits of his contemporaries, self-portraits and illustrations of scenes from the Bible. His self-portraits form a unique and intimate biography, in which the artist surveyed himself without vanity and with the utmost sincerity.\nIn his paintings and prints he exhibited knowledge of classical iconography, which he molded to fit the requirements of his own experience; thus, the depiction of a biblical scene was informed by Rembrandt's knowledge of the specific text, his assimilation of classical composition, and his observations of Amsterdam's Jewish population. Because of his empathy for the human condition, he has been called "one of the great prophets of civilization."	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rembrandt	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Rembrandt_Old_Woman.JPG",

98	King James I	James VI and I (19 June 1566 – 27 March 1625) was King of Scotland as James VI from 24 July 1567 and King of England and Ireland as James I from the union of the Scottish and English crowns on 24 March 1603 until his death. The kingdoms of Scotland and England were individual sovereign states, with their own parliaments, judiciary, and laws, though both were ruled by James in personal union.\nHe succeeded to the Scottish throne at the age of thirteen months, after his mother Mary, Queen of Scots, was compelled to abdicate in his favour. Four different regents governed during his minority, which ended officially in 1578, though he did not gain full control of his government until 1583. In 1603, he succeeded the last Tudor monarch of England and Ireland, Elizabeth I, who died without issue. He continued to reign in all three kingdoms for 22 years, a period known as the Jacobean era after him, until his death in 1625 at the age of 58. After the Union of the Crowns, he based himself in England (the largest of the three realms) from 1603, only returning to Scotland once in 1617, and styled himself "King of Great Britain and Ireland". He was a major advocate of a single parliament for both England and Scotland. In his reign, the Plantation of Ulster and British colonisation of the Americas began.\nAt 57 years and 246 days, his reign in Scotland was longer than any of his predecessors. He achieved most of his aims in Scotland but faced great difficulties in England, including the Gunpowder Plot in 1605 and repeated conflicts with the English Parliament. Under James, the "Golden Age" of Elizabethan literature and drama continued, with writers such as William Shakespeare, John Donne, Ben Jonson, and Sir Francis Bacon contributing to a flourishing literary culture. James himself was a talented scholar, the author of works such as Daemonologie (1597), True Law of Free Monarchies (1598), and Basilikon Doron (1599). He sponsored the translation of the Bible that was named after him: the Authorised King James Version. Sir Anthony Weldon claimed that James had been termed "the wisest fool in Christendom", an epithet associated with his character ever since. Since the latter half of the twentieth century, however, historians have revised James's reputation and have treated him as a serious and thoughtful monarch.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_VI_and_I	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Union_of_the_Crowns_Royal_Badge.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/James_I_of_England_by_Daniel_Mytens.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/James_I_of_England_404446.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/James_VI_of_Scotland_aged_20%2C_1586..jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/James_I_of_England_signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/King_James_I_of_England_and_VI_of_Scotland_by_Arnold_van_Brounckhorst.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/James_VI_unite_1609_662019.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Royal_Arms_of_England_%281399-1603%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/King_James_I_of_England_and_VI_of_Scotland_by_John_De_Critz_the_Elder.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_Kingdom_of_Scotland.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Royal_Arms_of_the_Kingdom_of_Scotland.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Coat_of_Arms_of_England_%281603-1649%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Canterbury_Cathedral%2C_view_of_the_Western_Towers_engraved_by_J.LeKeux_after_a_picture_by_G.Cattermole%2C_1821_edited.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Escutcheon_of_the_Duke_of_Rothesay.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Coat_of_Arms_of_Scotland_%281603-1649%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Anglican_rose.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Banqueting_House_802_crop.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Anne_of_Denmark-1605.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/James_I_and_his_royal_progeny_by_Willem_van_de_Passe_cropped.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/GeorgeVilliers.jpg"]	f	cover
188	Voltaire	François-Marie Arouet (French: [fʁɑ̃.swa ma.ʁi aʁ.wɛ]; 21 November 1694 – 30 May 1778), known by his nom de plume Voltaire (pronounced: [vɔl.tɛːʁ]), was a French Enlightenment writer, historian and philosopher famous for his wit, his attacks on the established Catholic Church, and his advocacy of freedom of religion, freedom of expression, and separation of church and state. Voltaire was a versatile writer, producing works in almost every literary form, including plays, poems, novels, essays, and historical and scientific works. He wrote more than 20,000 letters and more than 2,000 books and pamphlets. He was an outspoken advocate, despite the risk this placed him in under the strict censorship laws of the time. As a satirical polemicist, he frequently made use of his works to criticize intolerance, religious dogma, and the French institutions of his day.\n\n	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaire	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Atelier_de_Nicolas_de_Largilli%C3%A8re%2C_portrait_de_Voltaire%2C_d%C3%A9tail_%28mus%C3%A9e_Carnavalet%29_-002.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Tafelrunde.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Voltaire%27s_tomb.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Voltaire%27s_chateau%2C_Ferney.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Voltaire-last-house.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Voltaire-Baquoy.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Voltaire_Philosophy_of_Newton_frontispiece.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/VoltaireCandidFrontis%2BChap01-1762.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Voltaire_dictionary.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Voltaire_by_Jean-Antoine_Houdon_%281778%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Flag_of_Spain_%281785-1873_and_1875-1931%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Prinsenvlag.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Atelier_de_Nicolas_de_Largilli%C3%A8re%2C_portrait_de_Voltaire%2C_d%C3%A9tail_%28mus%C3%A9e_Carnavalet%29_-002.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Flag_of_Prussia_1892-1918.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/D%27apr%C3%A8s_Maurice_Quentin_de_La_Tour%2C_Portrait_de_Voltaire%2C_d%C3%A9tail_du_visage_%28ch%C3%A2teau_de_Ferney%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Quill_and_ink.svg"]	f	cover
136	Guarneri	The Guarneri (often referred to in the Latinized form Guarnerius) is the family name of a group of distinguished luthiers from Cremona in Italy in the 17th and 18th centuries, whose standing is considered comparable to those of the Amati and Stradivari families. A branch of the family, the Garnaouis, lives in the city of Sousse in Tunisia. Some of the world's most famous violinists, such as Niccolò Paganini, Jascha Heifetz, Yehudi Menuhin have preferred Guarneris to Stradivaris. The average Stradivari is stronger in the 200 Hz and 250 Hz bands and above 1.6 kHz. Del Gesùs are on average stronger from 315 Hz up to 1.25 kHz. These differences are perceived as a more brilliant sound and stronger fundamentals of the lowest notes of the Stradivari, versus a darker sound in the del Gesùs.\nAndrea Guarneri (c. 1626 - 7 December 1698) was an apprentice in the workshop of Nicolo Amati from 1641 to 1646 and returned to make violins for Amati from 1650 to 1654. His early instruments are generally based on the "Grand Amati" pattern but struggled to achieve the sophistication of Amati's own instruments. Andrea Guarneri produced some fine violas, one of which was played by William Primrose.\n	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guarneri	[]	f	cover
125	Homophony	In music, homophony (/hɵˈmɒfəni/; Greek: ὁμόφωνος, homóphōnos, from ὁμός, homós, "same" and φωνή, phōnē, "sound, tone") is a texture in which two or more parts move together in harmony, the relationship between them creating chords. This is distinct from polyphony, in which parts move with rhythmic independence, and monophony, in which all parts (if there are multiple parts) move in parallel rhythm and pitch. A homophonic texture is also homorhythmic (or uses a "very similar rhythm"). However, in melody-dominated homophony, one voice, often the highest, plays a distinct melody, and the accompanying voices work together to articulate an underlying harmony. Initially, in Ancient Greece, homophony indicated music in which a single melody is performed by two or more voices in unison or octaves, i.e. monophony with multiple voices.\nHomophony as a term first appeared in English with Charles Burney in 1776, emphasizing the concord of harmonized melody.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophony	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/If_ye_love_me.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Chopin_op62_no2_new.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/If_ye_love_me.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg"]	f	cover
130	Oratorio	An oratorio is a large musical composition for orchestra, choir, and soloists. Like an opera, an oratorio includes the use of a choir, soloists, an ensemble, various distinguishable characters, and arias. However, opera is musical theatre, while oratorio is strictly a concert piece—though oratorios are sometimes staged as operas, and operas are sometimes presented in concert form. In an oratorio there is generally little or no interaction between the characters, and no props or elaborate costumes. A particularly important difference is in the typical subject matter of the text. Opera tends to deal with history and mythology, including age-old devices of romance, deception, and murder, whereas the plot of an oratorio often deals with sacred topics, making it appropriate for performance in the church. Protestant composers took their stories from the Bible, while Catholic composers looked to the lives of saints, as well as to Biblical topics. Oratorios became extremely popular in early 17th-century Italy partly because of the success of opera and the Catholic Church's prohibition of spectacles during Lent. Oratorios became the main choice of music during that period for opera audiences.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oratorio	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Handel_Messiah_Hallelujah_by_Oratorio_Chorus.ogg"]	f	cover
208	George III of the United Kingdom	George III (George William Frederick; 4 June 1738 – 29 January 1820) was King of Great Britain and King of Ireland from 25 October 1760 until the union of these two countries on 1 January 1801, after which he was King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland until his death. He was concurrently Duke and prince-elector of Brunswick-Lüneburg ("Hanover") in the Holy Roman Empire until his promotion to King of Hanover on 12 October 1814. He was the third British monarch of the House of Hanover, but unlike his two Hanoverian predecessors he was born in Britain, spoke English as his first language, and never visited Hanover.\nHis life and reign, which were longer than any other British monarch before him, were marked by a series of military conflicts involving his kingdoms, much of the rest of Europe, and places farther afield in Africa, the Americas and Asia. Early in his reign, Great Britain defeated France in the Seven Years' War, becoming the dominant European power in North America and India. However, many of its American colonies were soon lost in the American Revolutionary War. Further wars against revolutionary and Napoleonic France from 1793 concluded in the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.\nIn the later part of his life, George III suffered from recurrent, and eventually permanent, mental illness. Although it has since been suggested that he suffered from the blood disease porphyria, the cause of his illness remains unknown. After a final relapse in 1810, a regency was established, and George III's eldest son, George, Prince of Wales, ruled as Prince Regent. On George III's death, the Prince Regent succeeded his father as George IV.\nHistorical analysis of George III's life has gone through a "kaleidoscope of changing views" that have depended heavily on the prejudices of his biographers and the sources available to them. Until re-assessment occurred during the second half of the twentieth century, his reputation in the United States was one of a tyrant and in Britain he became "the scapegoat for the failure of imperialism".	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4b/GeorgeIIIGuinea.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/National-Debt-Gillray.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Prince_of_Wales%27s_feathers_Badge.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/The_king_of_Brobdingnag_and_Gulliver.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Francis_Ayscough_with_the_Prince_of_Wales_%28later_King_George_III%29_and_Edward_Augustus%2C_Duke_of_York_and_Albany_by_Richard_Wilson.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Floral_Badge_of_Great_Britain.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/George_III_1762.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/George_III_%28by_Allan_Ramsay%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/George_III_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/George_III_As_Prince_of_Wales.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/George_III_by_Henry_Meyer.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/George_III_Zoffany.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/King_George_III_by_Sir_William_Beechey_%282%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/George_III_in_Coronation_edit.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%281801-1816%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Coat_of_Arms_of_the_Hanoverian_Princes_of_Wales_%281714-1760%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Daughters_of_King_George_III.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%281816-1837%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/A-Kick-at-the-Broad-Bottoms-Gillray.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Coat_of_Arms_of_Great_Britain_%281714-1801%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Bookplate-George_Prince_of_Wales.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Flag_of_Hanover_1837-1866.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Flag_of_Hanover_%281692%29.svg"]	f	cover
148	John Bunyan	John Bunyan (28 November 1628 – 31 August 1688) was an English Christian writer and preacher. He is the author of The Pilgrim's Progress, arguably the most famous published Christian allegory. In addition to The Pilgrim's Progress, Bunyan wrote nearly sixty titles, many of them expanded sermons.\nBunyan faced legal challenges to fulfilling his calling but did not make any concessions to the authorities. As a dissenter who was not ordained in the Church of England he was unlicensed to preach. He preferred to face and endure twelve years of imprisonment at great sacrifice to himself and his family, rather than resign himself to giving up preaching. Although he has been described both as a Baptist and as a Puritan, he himself preferred to be described simply as a Christian.\nHe is remembered in the Church of England with a Lesser Festival on 30 August, and on the liturgical calendar of the United States Episcopal Church on 29 August. Some other Churches of the Anglican Communion, such as the Anglican Church of Australia, honour him on the day of his death (31 August) together with Aidan of Lindisfarne.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bunyan	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3a/Baptism_logo.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/John_Bunyan_effigy%2C_Bunhill_Fields.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/John_Bunyan.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/P_christianity.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Nicaea_icon.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Birth_place_of_Bunyan.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Gloriole_blur.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Bunyan_in_prison.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg"]	f	cover
152	Theory	Theory is a group of ideas meant to explain a certain topic of science, such as a single or collection of fact(s), event(s), or phenomen(a)(on). Typically, a theory is developed through the use of contemplative and rational forms of abstract and generalized thinking. Furthermore, a theory is often based on general principles that are independent of the thing being explained. Depending on the context, the results might for example include generalized explanations of how nature works. The word has its roots in ancient Greek, but in modern use it has taken on several different related meanings. A theory is not the same as a hypothesis. A theory provides an explanatory framework for some observation, and from the assumptions of the explanation follows a number of possible hypotheses that can be tested in order to provide support for, or challenge, the theory. Someone who develops theories is called a theorist.\nOne modern group of meanings emphasizes the speculative and generalizing nature of theory. For example in the arts and philosophy, the term "theoretical" may be used to describe ideas and empirical phenomena which are not easily measurable. And by extension of the philosophical meaning, "theoria" is also a word still used in theological contexts. As already in Aristotle's definitions, theory is very often contrasted to "practice" (from Greek praxis, πρᾶξις) a Greek term for "doing", which is opposed to theory because pure theory involves no doing apart from itself. A classical example of the distinction between "theoretical" and "practical" uses the discipline of medicine: medical theory involves trying to understand the causes and nature of health and sickness, while the practical side of medicine is trying to make people healthy. These two things are related but can be independent, because it is possible to research health and sickness without curing specific patients, and it is possible to cure a patient without knowing how the cure worked.\nIn modern science, the term "theory" refers to scientific theories, a well-confirmed type of explanation of nature, made in a way consistent with scientific method, and fulfilling the criteria required by modern science. Such theories are described in such a way that any scientist in the field is in a position to understand and either provide empirical support ("verify") or empirically contradict ("falsify") it. Scientific theories are the most reliable, rigorous, and comprehensive form of scientific knowledge, in contrast to more common uses of the word "theory" that imply that something is unproven or speculative (which is better defined by the word 'hypothesis'). Scientific theories are distinguished from hypotheses, which are individual empirically testable conjectures, and scientific laws, which are descriptive accounts of how nature will behave under certain conditions.\nA theory can be "normative (or prescriptive), meaning a postulation about what ought to be. It provides "goals, norms, and standards".\nA theory can be a body of knowledge, which may or may not be associated with particular explanatory models. To theorize is to develop this body of knowledge.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg"]	f	cover
154	Technology	Technology (from Greek τέχνη, techne, "art, skill, cunning of hand"; and -λογία, -logia) is the making, modification, usage, and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques, crafts, systems, and methods of organization, in order to solve a problem, improve a pre-existing solution to a problem, achieve a goal, handle an applied input/output relation or perform a specific function. It can also refer to the collection of such tools, including machinery, modifications, arrangements and procedures. Technologies significantly affect human as well as other animal species' ability to control and adapt to their natural environments. The term can either be applied generally or to specific areas: examples include construction technology, medical technology, and information technology.\nThe human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistorical discovery of the ability to control fire increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans in travelling in and controlling their environment. Recent technological developments, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. However, not all technology has been used for peaceful purposes; the development of weapons of ever-increasing destructive power has progressed throughout history, from clubs to nuclear weapons.\nTechnology has affected society and its surroundings in a number of ways. In many societies, technology has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as pollution, and deplete natural resources, to the detriment of Earth's environment. Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, a term originally applied only to machines, and the challenge of traditional norms.\nPhilosophical debates have arisen over the present and future use of technology in society, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, opining that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition. Indeed, until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but recent scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and learned to pass their knowledge to other generations.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Zoom_lunette_ardente.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/USAF_F-16A_F-15C_F-15E_Desert_Storm_edit2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Office-book.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/N%C3%A9olithique_0001.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Wheel_Iran.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Telecom-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Astronaut-EVA.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Clovis_Point.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Chopper_of_Dmanisi.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Gorilla_tool_use.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/FrameBreaking-1812.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Biface_de_St_Acheul_MHNT.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/C4004_%28Intel%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Boeing_747-8_Test_Planes_in_Assembly.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Late_model_Ford_Model_T.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Handtiegelpresse_von_1811.jpg"]	f	cover
157	Galileo Galilei	Galileo Galilei (Italian pronunciation: [ɡaliˈlɛːo ɡaliˈlɛi]; 15 February 1564 – 8 January 1642), often known mononymously as Galileo, was an Italian physicist, mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher who played a major role in the scientific revolution. His achievements include improvements to the telescope and consequent astronomical observations and support for Copernicanism. Galileo has been called the "father of modern observational astronomy", the "father of modern physics", the "father of science", and "the Father of Modern Science".\nHis contributions to observational astronomy include the telescopic confirmation of the phases of Venus, the discovery of the four largest satellites of Jupiter (named the Galilean moons in his honour), and the observation and analysis of sunspots. Galileo also worked in applied science and technology, inventing an improved military compass and other instruments.\nGalileo's championing of heliocentrism was controversial within his lifetime, when most subscribed to either geocentrism or the Tychonic system. He met with opposition from astronomers, who doubted heliocentrism due to the absence of an observed stellar parallax. The matter was investigated by the Roman Inquisition in 1615, which concluded that heliocentrism was false and contrary to scripture, placing works advocating the Copernican system on the index of banned books and forbidding Galileo from advocating heliocentrism. Galileo later defended his views in Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, which appeared to attack Pope Urban VIII, thus alienating not only the Pope but also the Jesuits, who had both supported Galileo up until this point. He was tried by the Holy Office, then found "vehemently suspect of heresy", was forced to recant, and spent the rest of his life under house arrest. It was while Galileo was under house arrest that he wrote one of his finest works, Two New Sciences, in which he summarised the work he had done some forty years earlier, on the two sciences now called kinematics and strength of materials.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Phases-of-Venus.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Suor_maria_celeste.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Pisa.Duomo.dome.Riminaldi01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Tomb_of_Galileo_Galilei.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Tito_Lessi_-_Galileo_and_Viviani.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Galileo_Galilei_Signature_2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Galileo_Galilei01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Galileo_manuscript.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Galileo_facing_the_Roman_Inquisition.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Bertini_fresco_of_Galileo_Galilei_and_Doge_of_Venice.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Galileo%27s_geometrical_and_military_compass_in_Putnam_Gallery%2C_2009-11-24.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Galilee.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fe/2009_Austria_25_Euro_Year_of_Astronomy_Front.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Justus_Sustermans_-_Portrait_of_Galileo_Galilei%2C_1636.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Galileo_telescope_replica.jpg"]	f	cover
162	Idola specus	Idola specus (singular Idolum specus), normally translated as "Idols of the Cave" (or "Idols of the Den"), is a type of logical fallacy whereby the peculiar biases of individuals lead them to errors. This Latin term was coined by Sir Francis Bacon and used in his Novum Organum, one of the earliest treatises arguing the case for the logic and method of modern science. He described them as deriving from "the peculiar constitution, mental or bodily, of each individual; and also in education, habit, and accident".\nThe idola specus are prejudices, by which individuals inappropriately extend norms or tenets that derive his or her own culture and social group, or to his or her own preferences. Racism, sexism and, more generally chauvinism are examples of idola specus, but the concept goes beyond them to the criticism of all forms of irreflexive subjectivity or individual predisposition.\nThe term is one of four such "idols" which represent "idols and false notions which are now in possession of the human understanding, and have taken deep root therein, not only so beset men's minds that truth can hardly find entrance, but even after entrance is obtained, they will again in the very instauration of the sciences meet and trouble us, unless men being forewarned of the danger fortify themselves as far as may be against their assaults".\nBesides idola specus, there are also idola tribus (Idols of the Tribe, caused by human nature), idola fori, (Idols of the Market Place, caused by language) and idola theatri (Idols of the Theatre, which are caused by the influence of philosophers).\n\nThe Idols of the Cave are the idols of the individual man. For everyone (besides the errors common to human nature in general) has a cave or den of his own, which refracts and discolors the light of nature, owing either to his own proper and peculiar nature; or to his education and conversation with others; or to the reading of books, and the authority of those whom he esteems and admires; or to the differences of impressions, accordingly as they take place in a mind preoccupied and predisposed or in a mind indifferent and settled; or the like. So that the spirit of man (according as it is meted out to different individuals) is in fact a thing variable and full of perturbation, and governed as it were by chance. Whence it was well observed by Heraclitus that men look for sciences in their own lesser worlds, and not in the greater or common world.\n— Novum Organum, Aphorism XLII\n\nIn more detail, Bacon said that there are a "great number and variety" of idols of the cave but he choose to select example which give "the most important caution", and which "have most effect in disturbing the clearness of the understanding". He judged that they "grow for the most part either out of the predominance of a favorite subject, or out of an excessive tendency to compare or to distinguish, or out of partiality for particular ages, or out of the largeness or minuteness of the objects contemplated." Concerning these most important variants he wrote in more detail:\nOne common reason for a prejudice is that people "become attached to certain particular sciences and speculations, either because they fancy themselves the authors and inventors thereof, or because they have bestowed the greatest pains upon them and become most habituated to them."\nBacon remarks that with respect to philosophy and science, there are two radically different types of minds. These manifest idola specus in different ways, but both suffer from it. Some "steady and acute" minds are "stronger and apter to mark the differences of things", fixing upon "the subtlest distinctions". Others are "lofty and discursive" and more prone to mark resemblances, recognizing and puttting together "the finest and most general resemblances". "Both kinds, however, easily err in excess, by catching the one at gradations, the other at shadows."\nBacon also notes another distinction which causes different manifestations of idola specus: "There are found some minds given to an extreme admiration of antiquity, others to an extreme love and appetite for novelty; but few so duly tempered that they can hold the mean, neither carping at what has been well laid down by the ancients, nor despising what is well introduced by the moderns. "\nFinally, another common cause of idola specus when looking specifically at "contemplations of nature" is that this sometimes requires looking at things in their "simple form". This break ups and distracts the understanding. Bacon mentions Leucippus and Democritus as compared with the other philosophies. For that school is so busied with the particles that it hardly attends to the structure. On the other hand "contemplations of nature and bodies in their composition and configuration overpower and dissolve the understanding". And some contemplators of nature become "so lost in admiration of the structure that they do not penetrate to the simplicity of nature". As a way of avoiding these problems, Bacon recommends that these two types of contemplation should be "alternated and taken by turns, so that the understanding may be rendered at once penetrating and comprehensive, and the inconveniences above mentioned, with the idols which proceed from them, may be avoided".\nBacon also drew general advice for more methodical future study of nature, aimed at avoiding the idols of the cave: "generally let every student of nature take this as a rule: that whatever his mind seizes and dwells upon with peculiar satisfaction is to be held in suspicion, and that so much the more care is to be taken in dealing with such questions to keep the understanding even and clear."	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idola_specus	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg"]	f	cover
173	Principia Mathematica	The Principia Mathematica is a three-volume work on the foundations of mathematics, written by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell and published in 1910, 1912, and 1913. In 1927, it appeared in a second edition with an important Introduction To the Second Edition, an Appendix A that replaced ✸9 and an all-new Appendix C.\nPM, as it is often abbreviated, was an attempt to describe a set of axioms and inference rules in symbolic logic from which all mathematical truths could in principle be proven. As such, this ambitious project is of great importance in the history of mathematics and philosophy, being one of the foremost products of the belief that such an undertaking may have been achievable. However, in 1931, Gödel's incompleteness theorem proved definitively that PM, and in fact any other attempt, could never achieve this lofty goal; that is, for any set of axioms and inference rules proposed to encapsulate mathematics, there would in fact be some truths of mathematics which could not be deduced from them.\nOne of the main inspirations and motivations for PM was the earlier work of Gottlob Frege on logic, which Russell discovered allowed for the construction of paradoxical sets. PM sought to avoid this problem by ruling out the unrestricted creation of arbitrary sets. This was achieved by replacing the notion of a general set with notion of a hierarchy of sets of different 'types', a set of a certain type only allowed to contain sets of strictly lower types. Contemporary mathematics, however, avoids paradoxes such as Russell's in less unwieldy ways, such as the system of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory.\nPM is not to be confused with Russell's 1903 Principles of Mathematics. PM states: "The present work was originally intended by us to be comprised in a second volume of Principles of Mathematics... But as we advanced, it became increasingly evident that the subject is a very much larger one than we had supposed; moreover on many fundamental questions which had been left obscure and doubtful in the former work, we have now arrived at what we believe to be satisfactory solutions."\nThe Modern Library placed it 23rd in a list of the top 100 English-language nonfiction books of the twentieth century.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Pmdsgdbhxdfgb2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Venn_A_intersect_B.svg"]	f	cover

Enlightened monarchs embraced the principles of the Enlightenment, especially its emphasis upon rationality, and applied them to their territories. They tended to allow religious toleration, freedom of speech and the press, and the right to hold private property.

191	Noble savage	The term noble savage is a literary stock character that expresses the concept of an idealized indigene, outsider, or "other" who has not been "corrupted" by civilization, and therefore symbolizes humanity's innate goodness. In English, the phrase first appeared in the 17th century in John Dryden's heroic play, The Conquest of Granada (1672), wherein it was used by a Christian prince, believing himself a Spanish Muslim, in reference to himself, but it later became identified with the idealized picture of "nature's gentleman", which was an aspect of 18th-century sentimentalism. The noble savage achieved prominence as an oxymoronic rhetorical device after 1851, when used sarcastically as the title for a satirical essay by English novelist Charles Dickens, whom some believe may have wished to disassociate himself from what he viewed as the "feminine" sentimentality of 18th and early 19th-century romantic primitivism.\nThe idea that humans are essentially good is often attributed to the 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury, a Whig supporter of constitutional monarchy. In his Inquiry Concerning Virtue (1699), Shaftesbury had postulated that the moral sense in humans is natural and innate and based on feelings rather than resulting from the indoctrination of a particular religion. Shaftesbury was reacting to Thomas Hobbes's justification of an absolutist central state in his Leviathan, Chapter XIII, in which Hobbes famously holds that the state of nature is a "war of all against all" in which men's lives are "solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short". Hobbes further calls the American Indians an example of a contemporary people living in such a state. Although writers since antiquity had described people living in pre-civilized conditions, Hobbes is credited with inventing the term "State of Nature". Ross Harrison writes that "Hobbes seems to have invented this useful term."\nContrary to what is sometimes believed, Jean-Jacques Rousseau never used the phrase 'noble savage'.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_savage	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Atala_au_tombeau%2C1808%2CGirodet_de_Roussy_-Trioson%2C_Louvre..JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Southerne_Oroonoko_1776_performance.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Benjamin_west_Death_wolfe_noble_savage.jpg"]	f	cover
194	Transcendentalism	Transcendentalism is a religious and philosophical movement that was developed during the late 1820s and 1830s in the Eastern region of the United States as a protest against the general state of spirituality and, in particular, the state of intellectualism at Harvard University and the doctrine of the Unitarian church taught at Harvard Divinity School. Among the transcendentalists' core beliefs was the inherent goodness of both people and nature.\nTranscendentalists believe that society and its institutions—particularly organized religion and political parties—ultimately corrupt the purity of the individual. They have faith that people are at their best when truly "self-reliant" and independent. It is only from such real individuals that true community could be formed.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendentalism	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/P_religion_world.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg"]	f	cover
205	Robert Walpole	Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford, KG, KB, PC (26 August 1676 – 18 March 1745), known before 1742 as Sir Robert Walpole, was a British statesman who is generally regarded as the first Prime Minister of Great Britain. Although the position of "Prime Minister" had no recognition in law or official use at the time, Walpole is nevertheless acknowledged as having held the office de facto because of his influence within the Ministry.\nA Whig who was first elected to parliament in 1701, Walpole served during the reigns of George I and George II. Some sources date his tenure as "Prime Minister" from 1730 when, with the retirement of Lord Townshend, he became the sole and undisputed leader of the Cabinet. But his premiership is normally dated from 1721, when he became First Lord of the Treasury; this was generally upheld by the contemporary press, most notably that of the opposition, who focused far more attention on Walpole than on Townshend. Walpole continued to govern until 1742; he was not only the first but also the longest serving Prime Minister in British history.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Walpole	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28HM_Government%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Robert_Walpole_prime_minister_of_Britain.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/The_Stature_of_a_Great_Man_or_the_English_Colossus_cph.3b03411.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Charles_Townshend%2C_2nd_Viscount_Townshend_by_Sir_Godfrey_Kneller%2C_Bt_%282%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Robert_Walpole_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Retuched_Painting_of_Robert_Walpole.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/WalpoleArms.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Walpole%27s_reign2.jpg"]	f	cover
343	Eli Whitney	Eli Whitney (December 8, 1765 – January 8, 1825) was an American inventor best known for inventing the cotton gin. This was one of the key inventions of the Industrial Revolution and shaped the economy of the Antebellum South. Whitney's invention made upland short cotton into a profitable crop, which strengthened the economic foundation of slavery in the United States. Despite the social and economic impact of his invention, Whitney lost many profits in legal battles over patent infringement for the cotton gin. Thereafter, he turned his attention into securing contracts with the government in the manufacture of muskets for the newly formed United States Army. He continued making arms and inventing until his death in 1825.	\N	\N	\N	http://0.tqn.com/d/inventors/1/0/o/W/cotton_gin.gif	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Whitney	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/44/Whitney_Gin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f2/EliWhitneyGraveSouthSideGroveStCemeteryNewHavenCT04152008.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Eli_Whitney_by_Samuel_Finley_Breese_Morse_1822.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Eli_Whitney_1940_Issue-1c.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Eli_Whitney_signature_from_1846_memoir.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Cotton_gin_EWM_2007.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Eli_Whitney%27s_first_contract_as_a_gunfounder_signed_by_Oliver_Ellsworth_1786.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Cotton_gin_harpers.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Petition_of_Eli_Whitney_to_Selectmen_of_Westborough_Massachusetts.jpg"]	f	cover
246	Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen	The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, or (French: Déclaration des droits de l'homme et du citoyen) of August 1789 is a fundamental document of the French Revolution and in the history of human rights. It defines the individual and collective rights of all the estates of the realm as universal. Influenced by the doctrine of "natural right", the rights of man are held to be universal: valid at all times and in every place, pertaining to human nature itself. It became the basis for a nation of free individuals protected equally by law. It is included in the preamble of the constitutions of both the Fourth French Republic (1946) and Fifth Republic (1958) and is still current. Inspired in part by the American Revolution, the Declaration was a core statement of the values of the French revolution and had a major impact on the development of liberty and democracy in Europe and worldwide.\n\n	\N	\N	\N	http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_IJiIHiKdHbk/TOEYg4A4qoI/AAAAAAAAABY/Mdl91MX2-Hg/s1600/555_1064_image_dafanch01_pc45003489_2.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Prinsenvlag.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen_in_1789.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Flag_of_Spain_%281785-1873_and_1875-1931%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Flag_of_Prussia_1892-1918.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg"]	f	cover

256	Reign of Terror	The Reign of Terror (5 September 1793 – 28 July 1794), also known simply as The Terror (French: la Terreur), was a period of violence that occurred after the onset of the French Revolution, incited by conflict between rival political factions, the Girondins and the Jacobins, and marked by mass executions of "enemies of the revolution". The death toll ranged in the tens of thousands, with 16,594 executed by guillotine (2,639 in Paris), and another 25,000 in summary executions across France.\nThe guillotine (called the "National Razor") became the symbol of the revolutionary cause, strengthened by a string of executions: King Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, the Girondins, Philippe Égalité (Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans), and Madame Roland, and others such as pioneering chemist Antoine Lavoisier, lost their lives under its blade. During 1794, revolutionary France was beset with conspiracies by internal and foreign enemies. Within France, the revolution was opposed by the French nobility, which had lost its inherited privileges. The Roman Catholic Church was generally against the Revolution, which had turned the clergy into employees of the state and required they take an oath of loyalty to the nation (through the Civil Constitution of the Clergy). In addition, the First French Republic was engaged in a series of wars with neighboring powers intent on crushing the revolution to prevent its spread.\nThe extension of civil war and the advance of foreign armies on national territory produced a political crisis and increased the rivalry between the Girondins and the more radical Jacobins. The latter were eventually grouped in the parliamentary faction called the Mountain, and they had the support of the Parisian population. The French government established the Committee of Public Safety, which took its final form on 6 September 1793 in order to suppress internal counter-revolutionary activities and raise additional French military forces.\nThrough the Revolutionary Tribunal, the Terror's leaders exercised broad dictatorial powers and used them to instigate mass executions and political purges. The repression accelerated in June and July 1794, a period called la Grande Terreur (the Great Terror), and ended in the coup of 9 Thermidor Year II (27 July 1794), leading to the Thermidorian Reaction, in which several instigators of the Reign of Terror were executed, including Saint-Just and Robespierre.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Octobre_1793%2C_supplice_de_9_%C3%A9migr%C3%A9s.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign_of_Terror	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Terreur_Noyades_Nantes.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Bernard%2C_Andr%C3%A9_Antoine.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Robespierre_ex%C3%A9cutant_le_bourreau.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Fusillades_de_Nantes.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Prinsenvlag.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Octobre_1793%2C_supplice_de_9_%C3%A9migr%C3%A9s.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Execution_robespierre%2C_saint_just....jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Tribunal_r%C3%A9volutionnaire_04.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Flag_of_Spain_%281785-1873_and_1875-1931%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Flag_of_Prussia_1892-1918.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/ca/Heads_on_pikes.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Robespierre.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Raffet_DerniereCharrette.jpg"]	f	cover
276	Program music	Program music or programme music is a type of art music that attempts to musically render an extra-musical narrative. The narrative itself might be offered to the audience in the form of program notes, inviting imaginative correlations with the music. A paradigmatic example is Hector Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique, which relates a drug-induced series of morbid fantasies concerning the unrequited love of a sensitive poet involving murder, execution, and the torments of Hell. The genre culminates in the symphonic works of Richard Strauss that include narrations of the adventures of Don Quixote, Till Eulenspiegel, the composer's domestic life, and an interpretation of Nietzsche's philosophy of the Superman. Following Strauss, the genre declined and new works with explicitly narrative content are rare. Nevertheless the genre continues to exert an influence on film music, especially where this draws upon the techniques of late romantic music.\nThe term is almost exclusively applied to works in the European classical music tradition, particularly those from the Romantic music period of the 19th century, during which the concept was popular, but pieces which fit the description have long been a part of music. The term is usually reserved for purely instrumental works (pieces without singers and lyrics), and not used, for example for Opera or Lieder. Single movement orchestral pieces of program music are often called symphonic poems.\nAbsolute music, in contrast, is intended to be appreciated without any particular reference to the outside world.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_music	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg"]	f	cover
262	Hundred Days	The Hundred Days, sometimes known as the Hundred Days of Napoleon or Napoleon's Hundred Days, marked the period between Emperor Napoleon of France's return from exile on Elba to Paris on 20 March 1815 and the second restoration of King Louis XVIII on 8 July 1815 (a period of 111 days). This period saw the War of the Seventh Coalition, and includes the Waterloo Campaign and the Neapolitan War. The phrase les Cent Jours was first used by the prefect of Paris, Gaspard, comte de Chabrol, in his speech welcoming the King.\nNapoleon returned while the Congress of Vienna was sitting. On 13 March, seven days before Napoleon reached Paris, the powers at the Congress of Vienna declared him an outlaw, and on 25 March, five days after his arrival in Paris, Austria, Prussia, Russia and the United Kingdom, members of the Seventh Coalition, bound themselves to put 150,000 men each into the field to end his rule. This set the stage for the last conflict in the Napoleonic Wars, the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo, the restoration of the French monarchy for the second time and the permanent exile of Napoleon to the distant island of Saint Helena, where he died in May 1821.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Beaume_-_Napol%C3%A9on_Ier_quittant_l%27%C3%AEle_d%27Elbe_-_1836.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Days	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Napoleon%27s_exile_to_Elba3.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/Strategic_Situation_of_Western_Europe_1815.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Swiss_flag_Bachmann_1815.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Plas_Newydd_%28Anglesey%29_-_Waterloo_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/PortugueseFlag1750.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Retour_de_lIle_dElbe-Garneray-IMG_2247.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/State_flag_of_the_Grand_Duchy_of_Tuscany.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/62/PD-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Flag_of_the_Kingdom_of_the_Two_Sicilies_%281816%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Flagge_Herzogtum_Nassau_%281806-1866%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Flagge_Herzogtum_Braunschweig.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Napoleonic_Eagle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Invasion_of_France_in_1815.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Pavillon_royal_de_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Napoleonic_Wars_War_of_the_Seventh_Coalition.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Plan_de_la_Bataille_de_Belle_Alliance.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/People_icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4c/Flag_of_Sweden.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Flag_of_Spain_%281785-1873_and_1875-1931%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Flag_of_Hanover_1837-1866.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Flag_of_the_Kingdom_of_Naples_%281811%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Battle_of_Waterloo_1815.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Elba_Squadron_of_1er_r%C3%A9giment_de_chevau-l%C3%A9gers_lanciers_polonais_de_la_Garde_imp%C3%A9riale.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Beaume_-_Napol%C3%A9on_Ier_quittant_l%27%C3%AEle_d%27Elbe_-_1836.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Flag_of_the_Kingdom_of_Sardinia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Flag_of_the_Kingdom_of_Prussia_%281803-1892%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Waterloo_Campaign_map-alt3.svg"]	f	cover
270	Mary Shelley	Mary Shelley (née Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin; 30 August 1797 – 1 February 1851) was an English novelist, short story writer, dramatist, essayist, biographer, and travel writer, best known for her Gothic novel Frankenstein: or, The Modern Prometheus (1818). She also edited and promoted the works of her husband, the Romantic poet and philosopher Percy Bysshe Shelley. Her father was the political philosopher William Godwin, and her mother was the philosopher and feminist Mary Wollstonecraft.\nMary Godwin's mother died when she was eleven days old; afterwards, she and her older half-sister, Fanny Imlay, were raised by her father. When Mary was four, Godwin married his neighbour, Mary Jane Clairmont. Godwin provided his daughter with a rich, if informal, education, encouraging her to adhere to his liberal political theories. In 1814, Mary Godwin began a romantic relationship with one of her father’s political followers, the married Percy Bysshe Shelley. Together with Mary's stepsister, Claire Clairmont, they left for France and travelled through Europe; upon their return to England, Mary was pregnant with Percy's child. Over the next two years, she and Percy faced ostracism, constant debt, and the death of their prematurely born daughter. They married in late 1816 after the suicide of Percy Shelley's first wife, Harriet.\nIn 1816, the couple famously spent a summer with Lord Byron, John William Polidori, and Claire Clairmont near Geneva, Switzerland, where Mary conceived the idea for her novel Frankenstein. The Shelleys left Britain in 1818 for Italy, where their second and third children died before Mary Shelley gave birth to her last and only surviving child, Percy Florence. In 1822, her husband drowned when his sailing boat sank during a storm near Viareggio. A year later, Mary Shelley returned to England and from then on devoted herself to the upbringing of her son and a career as a professional author. The last decade of her life was dogged by illness, probably caused by the brain tumour that was to kill her at the age of 53.\nUntil the 1970s, Mary Shelley was known mainly for her efforts to publish Percy Shelley's works and for her novel Frankenstein, which remains widely read and has inspired many theatrical and film adaptations. Recent scholarship has yielded a more comprehensive view of Mary Shelley’s achievements. Scholars have shown increasing interest in her literary output, particularly in her novels, which include the historical novels Valperga (1823) and Perkin Warbeck (1830), the apocalyptic novel The Last Man (1826), and her final two novels, Lodore (1835) and Falkner (1837). Studies of her lesser-known works such as the travel book Rambles in Germany and Italy (1844) and the biographical articles for Dionysius Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopaedia (1829–46) support the growing view that Mary Shelley remained a political radical throughout her life. Mary Shelley's works often argue that cooperation and sympathy, particularly as practised by women in the family, were the ways to reform civil society. This view was a direct challenge to the individualistic Romantic ethos promoted by Percy Shelley and the Enlightenment political theories articulated by her father, William Godwin.	\N	\N	\N	http://www.ox.ac.uk/images/maincolumn/4400_Frankenstein_-_Mary_Shelley___Bodleian_Library.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Shelley	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/WilliamShelley.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Wollstonecraft_Shelley_Grave_1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/RothwellMaryShelley.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Portrait_of_Percy_Bysshe_Shelley_by_Curran%2C_1819.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/ShelleySharpeJuliet.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/St_Pancras_Old_Church_in_1815.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Claire_Clairmont%2C_by_Amelia_Curran.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Marywollstonecraft.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/MaryShelley.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Iris_centralheterochromy.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/Mary_and_Percy_Shelley._Engraving_by_George_Stodart_after_monument_by_Henry_Weekes.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/FrankensteinDraft.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/GodwinJournal.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Frontispiece_to_Frankenstein_1831.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Polygon.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Percy_Bysshe_Shelley_by_Alfred_Clint.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ec/Mary_Shelley_by_Reginald_Easton..jpg"]	f	75%
506	Modern science	The Scientific Revolution established science as a source for the growth of knowledge. During the 19th century, the practice of science became professionalized and institutionalized in ways that continued through the 20th century. As the role of scientific knowledge grew in society, it became incorporated with many aspects of the functioning of nation-states. The history of science is marked by a chain of advances in technology and knowledge that have always complemented each other. Technological innovations bring about new discoveries and are bred by other discoveries, which inspire new possibilities and approaches to longstanding science issues.	\N	\N	\N	http://i.huffpost.com/gen/285309/thumbs/s-MODERN-SCIENCE-SPIRITUALITY-large.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_science#Modern_science	[]	f	cover
379	Maurice Ravel	Joseph-Maurice Ravel (March 7, 1875 – December 28, 1937) was a French composer known especially for his melodies, orchestral and instrumental textures and effects. Along with Claude Debussy, he was one of the most prominent figures associated with Impressionist music. Much of his piano music, chamber music, vocal music and orchestral music has entered the standard concert repertoire.\nRavel's piano compositions, such as Jeux d'eau, Miroirs, Le tombeau de Couperin and Gaspard de la nuit, demand considerable virtuosity from the performer, and his orchestral music, including Daphnis et Chloé and his arrangement of Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition, use a variety of sound and instrumentation. Ravel is perhaps known best for his orchestral work Boléro (1928), which he considered trivial and once described as "a piece for orchestra without music".\nAccording to SACEM, Ravel's estate had earned more royalties than that of any other French composer.\n\n	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Ravel	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d6/Maurice_Ravel_-_Th%C3%A9r%C3%A8se_Dussaut_-_Pavane_pour_une_infante_d%C3%A9funte.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Debussy_-_La_Mer_-_The_great_wave_of_Kanaga_from_Hokusai.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Montfort-l%27Amaury_Maison_Ravel.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Maurice_Ravel_1925.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Ballerina-icon.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Classe_B%C3%A9riot_1895.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Ciboure_maison_natale_de_Maurice_Ravel.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Ravel_au_piano.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Ravel_Pierre_Petit.jpg"]	f	cover
293	Protectionism	Protectionism is the economic policy of restraining trade between states (countries) through methods such as tariffs on imported goods, restrictive quotas, and a variety of other government regulations designed to allow (according to proponents) fair competition between imports and goods and service produced domestically.\nThis policy contrasts with free trade, where government barriers to trade are kept to a minimum. In recent years, it has become closely aligned with anti-globalization. The term is mostly used in the context of economics, where protectionism refers to policies or doctrines which protect businesses and workers within a country by restricting or regulating trade with foreign nations.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectionism	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d2/Abandon_Free_Trade.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Emblem-money.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/SingaporePort1.JPG"]	f	cover
292	James Watt	James Watt, FRS, FRSE (/wɒt/; 19 January 1736 – 25 August 1819) was a Scottish inventor and mechanical engineer whose improvements to the Newcomen steam engine were fundamental to the changes brought by the Industrial Revolution in both his native Great Britain and the rest of the world.\nWhile working as an instrument maker at the University of Glasgow, Watt became interested in the technology of steam engines. He realised that contemporary engine designs wasted a great deal of energy by repeatedly cooling and re-heating the cylinder. Watt introduced a design enhancement, the separate condenser, which avoided this waste of energy and radically improved the power, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of steam engines. Eventually he adapted his engine to produce rotary motion, greatly broadening its use beyond pumping water.\nWatt attempted to commercialise his invention, but experienced great financial difficulties until he entered a partnership with Matthew Boulton in 1775. The new firm of Boulton and Watt was eventually highly successful and Watt became a wealthy man. In his retirement, Watt continued to develop new inventions though none were as significant as his steam engine work. He died in 1819 at the age of 83.\nHe developed the concept of horsepower and the SI unit of power, the watt, was named after him.	\N	\N	\N	http://www.nndb.com/people/531/000050381/james-watt.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Watt	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Watt_James_Chantrey.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/SteamEngine_Boulton%26Watt_1784.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Watt_apparatus_3.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/James_Watt_Memorial_College.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/James_Watt_Cottage_ruin%2C_Kinneil_House%2C_Bo%27ness.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/James_Watt_steam_engine_relic_at_the_Carron_Works.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/James_Watt_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/20070616_Dampfmaschine.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Watt_James_von_Breda.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/James_Watt_-_Heathfield.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/James_Watt%27s_Workshop.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Loughborough_Beam_Engine_-_geograph.org.uk_-_2734519.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Watts_First_Condenser.jpg"]	f	50%
312	James Cook	Captain James Cook, FRS, RN (7 November 1728 – 14 February 1779) was a British explorer, navigator, cartographer, and captain in the Royal Navy. Cook made detailed maps of Newfoundland prior to making three voyages to the Pacific Ocean, during which he achieved the first recorded European contact with the eastern coastline of Australia and the Hawaiian Islands, and the first recorded circumnavigation of New Zealand.\nCook joined the British merchant navy as a teenager and joined the Royal Navy in 1755. He saw action in the Seven Years' War, and subsequently surveyed and mapped much of the entrance to the Saint Lawrence River during the siege of Quebec. This helped bring Cook to the attention of the Admiralty and Royal Society. This notice came at a crucial moment in both Cook's career and the direction of British overseas exploration, and led to his commission in 1766 as commander of HM Bark Endeavour for the first of three Pacific voyages.\nIn three voyages Cook sailed thousands of miles across largely uncharted areas of the globe. He mapped lands from New Zealand to Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean in greater detail and on a scale not previously achieved. As he progressed on his voyages of discovery he surveyed and named features, and recorded islands and coastlines on European maps for the first time. He displayed a combination of seamanship, superior surveying and cartographic skills, physical courage and an ability to lead men in adverse conditions.\nCook was killed in Hawaii in a fight with Hawaiians during his third exploratory voyage in the Pacific in 1779. He left a legacy of scientific and geographical knowledge which was to influence his successors well into the 20th century and numerous memoria worldwide have been dedicated to him.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/John_Cleveley_the_Younger%2C_Views_of_the_South_Seas_%28b%29.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/James_Cook%2C_English_navigator%2C_witnessing_human_sacrifice_in_Taihiti_%28Otaheite%29_c._1773.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/H000104-_Feather_Cape.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/James_Cook_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f1/James_Cook_Blue_Plaque.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Cook-1777.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Captainjamescookportrait.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Cooks_Karte_von_Neufundland.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Cook_Three_Voyages_59.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Captain_Cook%2C_oil_on_canvas_by_John_Webber%2C_1776%2C_Museum_of_New_Zealand_Tepapa_Tongarewa%2C_Wellington.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/James_Cook%2C_Waimea_Kauai.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Captain_cook_statue_st_kilda.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Captain_Cook.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Zoffany_Death_of_Captain_Cook.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/John_Cleveley_the_Younger%2C_Views_of_the_South_Seas_%28b%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Endeavour_replica_in_Cooktown_harbour.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Elizabeth_Batts_Cook.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/James_Cook_Statue_in_Greenwich_-_Oct_2006.jpg"]	f	cover
338	Joseph Smith	Joseph Smith, Jr. (December 23, 1805 – June 27, 1844) was an American religious leader who founded the Latter Day Saint movement, the predominant branch of which is Mormonism. At age twenty-four, Smith published the Book of Mormon, and by the time of his death fourteen years later, he had attracted tens of thousands of followers, established cities and temples, and founded a religion and a religious culture that continues to the present day.\nSmith was born in Sharon, Vermont, and by 1817 had moved with his family to western New York, then the site of intense religious revivalism as part of the Second Great Awakening. There, according to Smith, he saw and heard a series of visions beginning in the early 1820s; in the first of these visions "two personages" (implied to be God the Father and the Son) appeared to him, and in subsequent visions an angel directed Smith to a buried book of golden plates inscribed with a Judeo-Christian history of an ancient American civilization. In 1830, Smith published what he said was an English translation of these plates, titled the Book of Mormon. Also in 1830, he organized the Church of Christ, calling it a restoration of the early Christian church. Church members were later called "Latter Day Saints", or "Mormons".\nIn 1831, Smith and his followers moved west with plans to build a communalistic American Zion. They gathered in Kirtland, Ohio, and established an outpost in Independence, Missouri, which was intended to be Zion's "center place". During the 1830s, Smith sent out missionaries, published revelations, and supervised construction of an expensive temple. However, due to the collapse of a church-sponsored bank and violent skirmishes with angry non-Mormon Missourians, Smith's dreams of building Zion in Missouri and Ohio failed by the end of the decade. In the early 1840s, Smith established a new city called Nauvoo, Illinois, where he was a spiritual and political leader. In 1844, Smith and the Nauvoo city council angered non-Mormons by ordering a printing press destroyed after it was used to publish an exposé critical of Smith's power and practice of polygamy. During the ensuing controversy, Smith was imprisoned in Carthage, Illinois, and killed when a mob stormed the jailhouse.\nDuring his lifetime, Smith published many revelations and other texts that his followers regard as scripture. His teachings include unique views about the nature of God, cosmology, family structures, political organization, and religious collectivism. His followers regard him as a prophet comparable to Moses and Elijah, while detractors view him as a false prophet or religious impostor. Smith's legacy includes many religious denominations, the largest of which are The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Community of Christ.\n\n	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Smith	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/The_Book_of_Mormon-_An_Account_Written_by_the_Hand_of_Mormon_upon_Plates_Taken_from_the_Plates_of_Nephi.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/The_Hill_Cumorah_by_C.C.A._Christensen.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/USVA_headstone_emb-11.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr._portrait_owned_by_Joseph_Smith_III.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/JosephSmithTranslating.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Joseph_Smith_Jr_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr._profile_by_Bathsheba_Smith_circa_1843.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Josephsmithtarandfeatherharpers.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Joseph_Smith_first_vision_stained_glass.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Liberty_Jail_by_C.C.A._Christensen.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/KirtlandTemple_Ohio_USA.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/NauvooTemple.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/NauvooLegion.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/EmmaSmith.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Christus_statue_temple_square_salt_lake_city.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Interior_of_Carthage_Jail_by_C.C.A._Christensen_%28cropped%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Golden_Plates_with_Urim_and_Thummim.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Assassination_of_Joseph_Smith.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Book_of_Mormon_English_Missionary_Edition_Soft_Cover.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/BYU_JSB.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/JosephSmithGrave.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/JSMB_main.jpg"]	f	cover
317	Napoleon III	Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte (20 April 1808 – 9 January 1873) was the first President of the French Republic and, as Napoleon III, the Emperor of the Second French Empire. He was the nephew and heir of Napoleon I. He was the first President of France to be elected by a direct popular vote. However, when he was blocked by the Constitution and Parliament from running for a second term, he organized a coup d'état in 1851, and then took the throne as Napoleon III on 2 December 1852, the forty-eighth anniversary of Napoleon I's coronation.\nDuring the first years of the Empire, his government imposed censorship and harsh repressive measures against his opponents. Some six thousand persons were imprisoned or sent to penal colonies Cayenne or Algeria until they were amnestied in 1859. Thousands more, including Victor Hugo, went into voluntary exile abroad. Beginning in 1862, Napoleon loosened the censorship and lifted many of the repressive measures, and gave the legislature more power, in what was known as "The Liberal Empire." Many of his opponents returned to France and became members of the National Assembly.\nNapoleon III is best known today for his reconstruction of Paris, carried out by his prefect of the Seine Baron Haussmann. He created the grand boulevards and squares of central Paris, made the Bois de Boulogne, Bois de Vincennes and other famous Paris parks, and built the Palais Garnier for the Paris Opera. He launched similar public works projects in Marseille, Lyon and other French cities.\nNapoleon III modernized the French banking system, encouraged the creation of savings and investment banks, greatly expanded and consolidated the French railroad system, and made the French merchant marine the second largest in the world. He promoted the building of the Suez Canal, and established modern agricultural schools and experimental farms, which ended famines in France and made France an agricultural exporter. He negotiated the first free trade agreement with Britain, which was followed by similar agreements with France's other European trading partners.\nNapoleon III also accomplished important social reforms, including giving French workers the right to strike and the right to organize. Under Napoleon III, women were allowed to take the baccalauréat examination, the first women were admitted to the Sorbonne, and public schools for girls were opened in all the communes of France with more than five hundred inhabitants. He also made history and geography required subjects in public schools, and introduced the first public school courses in modern languages, art, music, and gymnastics.\nIn foreign policy, Napoleon III aimed to reassert French influence in Europe and around the world. He was a supporter of popular sovereignty, and of nationalism.\nIn Europe, he allied with Britain and defeated Russia in the Crimean War (1854–56). In Italy, he assisted the cause of Italian nationalism and unification by allying with the Kingdom of Piedmont and defeating the Austrian army at the Battle of Magenta and the Battle of Solferino (1859). In return, in 1860 France received Savoy and Nice, restoring France to its pre-1815 borders. Later, however, to please French Catholics, he sent soldiers to Rome to defend the Papal States against annexation by Italy, and at the Battle of Mentana (1867) French troops defeated a small force of volunteers led by Giuseppe Garibaldi which was trying to capture Rome.\nNapoleon III doubled the area of the French overseas Empire; he established French rule in New Caledonia, and Cochinchina, established a protectorate in Cambodia (1863); colonized the interior of Senegal, and added Kabylie to French Algeria (1857).\nHe joined Britain sending an army to China during Second Opium War and the Taiping Rebellion (1860), opening China to trade with France, but French ventures to establish influence in Japan (1867) and Korea (1866) were less successful. His attempt to impose a European monarch, Maximilian I of Mexico on the Mexicans ended in a spectacular failure, costing the lives of thousands of Mexican and French soldiers and ending with the execution of Maximilian by the Mexicans in 1867.\nBeginning in 1866 Napoleon had to face the mounting power of Prussia, as Chancellor Otto von Bismarck sought German unification under Prussian leadership. In July 1870 Napoleon entered the Franco-Prussian War without allies and with inferior military forces. The French army was rapidly defeated and Napoleon III was captured at the Battle of Sedan. The French Third Republic was proclaimed in Paris, and Napoleon went into exile in England, where he died in 1873.\nNapoleon III holds the distinction of being both the first elected president and the last monarch of France.	\N	\N	\N	http://www.nndb.com/people/347/000086089/napoleon-iii-1.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_III	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Looting_of_the_Yuan_Ming_Yuan_by_Anglo_French_forces_in_1860.jpg",

334	Walt Whitman	Walter "Walt" Whitman (/ˈwɪtmən/; May 31, 1819 – March 26, 1892) was an American poet, essayist and journalist. A humanist, he was a part of the transition between transcendentalism and realism, incorporating both views in his works. Whitman is among the most influential poets in the American canon, often called the father of free verse. His work was very controversial in its time, particularly his poetry collection Leaves of Grass, which was described as obscene for its overt sexuality.\nBorn in Huntington on Long Island, Whitman worked as a journalist, a teacher, a government clerk, and—in addition to publishing his poetry—was a volunteer nurse during the American Civil War. Early in his career, he also produced a temperance novel, Franklin Evans (1842). Whitman's major work, Leaves of Grass, was first published in 1855 with his own money. The work was an attempt at reaching out to the common person with an American epic. He continued expanding and revising it until his death in 1892. After a stroke towards the end of his life, he moved to Camden, New Jersey, where his health further declined. He died at age 72 and his funeral became a public spectacle.\nWhitman's sexuality is often discussed alongside his poetry. Though biographers continue to debate his sexuality, he is usually described as either homosexual or bisexual in his feelings and attractions. However, there is disagreement among biographers as to whether Whitman had actual sexual experiences with men.\nWhitman was concerned with politics throughout his life. He supported the Wilmot Proviso and opposed the extension of slavery generally. His poetry presented an egalitarian view of the races, though his attitude in life reflected many of the racial prejudices common to nineteenth-century America and his opposition to slavery was not necessarily based on belief in the equality of races per se. At one point he called for the abolition of slavery, but later he saw the abolitionist movement as a threat to democracy.	\N	\N	\N	http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AXvqowwUqqw/UcuHuHtCV_I/AAAAAAAADZU/ie0HI2axF48/s1600/Walt-Whitman-leaves-of-grass-grashalmen.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Whitman	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Walt_Whitman_signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Walt_Whitman_-_George_Collins_Cox.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/%C2%A7Whitman%2C_Walt_%281819-1892%29_-_1887_-_ritr._da_Eakins%2C_Thomas_-_da_Internet.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Walt_Whitman_and_Bill_Duckett.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/WhitmanHouse-CamdenNJ1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Walt_Whitman_-_America.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/ShakespeareCandidates1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Quill_and_ink.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Walt_Whitman%2C_age_28%2C_1848.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Walt_Whitman%2C_1940.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Whitman%2C_Walt_%281819-1892%29_and_Doyle.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Manuscript_Whitman_Broadway_1861.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Walt_Whitman_-_Brady-Handy_restored.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Walt_Whitman%2C_steel_engraving%2C_July_1854.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Whitman_at_about_fifty.jpg"]	f	cover
331	Nathaniel Hawthorne	Nathaniel Hawthorne (born Nathaniel Hathorne; July 4, 1804 – May 19, 1864) was an American novelist and short story writer.\nHe was born in 1804 in Salem, Massachusetts to Nathaniel Hathorne and the former Elizabeth Clarke Manning. His ancestors include John Hathorne, the only judge involved in the Salem witch trials who never repented of his actions. Nathaniel later added a "w" to make his name "Hawthorne" in order to hide this relation. He entered Bowdoin College in 1821, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa in 1824, and graduated in 1825. Hawthorne published his first work, a novel titled Fanshawe, in 1828; he later tried to suppress it, feeling it was not equal to the standard of his later work. He published several short stories in various periodicals which he collected in 1837 as Twice-Told Tales. The next year, he became engaged to Sophia Peabody. He worked at a Custom House and joined Brook Farm, a transcendentalist community, before marrying Peabody in 1842. The couple moved to The Old Manse in Concord, Massachusetts, later moving to Salem, the Berkshires, then to The Wayside in Concord. The Scarlet Letter was published in 1850, followed by a succession of other novels. A political appointment took Hawthorne and family to Europe before their return to The Wayside in 1860. Hawthorne died on May 19, 1864, and was survived by his wife and their three children.\nMuch of Hawthorne's writing centers on New England, many works featuring moral allegories with a Puritan inspiration. His fiction works are considered part of the Romantic movement and, more specifically, Dark romanticism. His themes often center on the inherent evil and sin of humanity, and his works often have moral messages and deep psychological complexity. His published works include novels, short stories, and a biography of his friend Franklin Pierce.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Nathaniel_Hawthorne.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Hawthorne	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bf/Nathaniel_Hawthorne_by_Brady%2C_1860-65.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Nathaniel_Hawthorne_signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Nathaniel_Hawthorne_by_Whipple_c1848.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Tom_Sawyer_1876_frontispiece.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Nathaniel_Hawthorne_statue_-_Salem%2C_Massachusetts.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/CustomHouseStreet_Boston.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Nathaniel_Hawthorne.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/NHawthorneGrave.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Una_and_Julian_Hawthorne_c1850.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Midas_gold2.jpg"]	f	70%
335	Ralph Waldo Emerson	Ralph Waldo Emerson (May 25, 1803 – April 27, 1882) was an American essayist, lecturer, and poet, who led the Transcendentalist movement of the mid-19th century. He was seen as a champion of individualism and a prescient critic of the countervailing pressures of society, and he disseminated his thoughts through dozens of published essays and more than 1,500 public lectures across the United States.\nEmerson gradually moved away from the religious and social beliefs of his contemporaries, formulating and expressing the philosophy of Transcendentalism in his 1836 essay, Nature. Following this ground-breaking work, he gave a speech entitled "The American Scholar" in 1837, which Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. considered to be America's "Intellectual Declaration of Independence".\nEmerson wrote most of his important essays as lectures first, then revised them for print. His first two collections of essays – Essays: First Series and Essays: Second Series, published respectively in 1841 and 1844 – represent the core of his thinking, and include such well-known essays as Self-Reliance, The Over-Soul, Circles, The Poet and Experience. Together with Nature, these essays made the decade from the mid-1830s to the mid-1840s Emerson's most fertile period.\nEmerson wrote on a number of subjects, never espousing fixed philosophical tenets, but developing certain ideas such as individuality, freedom, the ability for humankind to realize almost anything, and the relationship between the soul and the surrounding world. Emerson's "nature" was more philosophical than naturalistic: "Philosophically considered, the universe is composed of Nature and the Soul."\nHis essays remain among the linchpins of American thinking,[citation needed] and his work has greatly influenced the thinkers, writers and poets that have followed him. When asked to sum up his work, he said his central doctrine was "the infinitude of the private man." Emerson is also well known as a mentor and friend of fellow Transcendentalist Henry David Thoreau.	\N	\N	\N	http://www.nndb.com/people/050/000031954/emerson-crop.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson_ca1857_retouched.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson_1940_Issue-3c.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Emerson_by_Johnson_1846-crop.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Emerson3_cropped.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Quill_and_ink.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Emersons_grave.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Appletons%27_Emerson_Ralph_Waldo_signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Representative_Men_1850.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Daguerreotype_Lydia_Jackson_Emerson_and_Edward_Waldo_Emerson_1840.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Close_up_of_Ralph_Waldo_Emerson%27s_grave.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/RWEmerson1859.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/RWEmerson.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg"]	f	60%
344	Thomas Edison	Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847 – October 18, 1931) was an American inventor and businessman. He developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world, including the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and a long-lasting, practical electric light bulb. Dubbed "The Wizard of Menlo Park", he was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of mass production and large-scale teamwork to the process of invention, and because of that, he is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory.\nEdison was a prolific inventor, holding 1,093 US patents in his name, as well as many patents in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. More significant than the number of Edison's patents, are the impacts of his inventions, because Edison not only invented things, his inventions established major new industries world-wide, notably, electric light and power utilities, sound recording and motion pictures. Edison's inventions contributed to mass communication and, in particular, telecommunications. These included a stock ticker, a mechanical vote recorder, a battery for an electric car, electrical power, recorded music and motion pictures.\nHis advanced work in these fields was an outgrowth of his early career as a telegraph operator. Edison developed a system of electric-power generation and distribution to homes, businesses, and factories – a crucial development in the modern industrialized world. His first power station was on Pearl Street in Manhattan, New York.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Thomas_Edison2.jpg/220px-Thomas_Edison2.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Thomas_Edison2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Young_Thomas_Edison.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/%D0%AD%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%BD_%D0%A2%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%81_%D0%90%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B2%D0%B0_%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BE_%D0%96%D0%97%D0%9B.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Edison_and_phonograph_edit1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Office-book.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/SS_Columbia_Undated_Photograph.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/PyramidParthenon.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Thomas_Alva_Edison_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Telecom-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Thomas_Edison_Mary_had_lamb.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Thomas_Edison_1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/GE_Schenectady.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Ford_Edison_Firestone1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Leonard_Cushing_Kinetograph_1894.ogv", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Abraham_Archibald_Anderson_-_Thomas_Alva_Edison_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Edison_bulb.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Edison_battery_exhibit%2C_1915.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Mina_Edison_1906.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/Menlo_Park_Laboratory.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Light_bulb_Edison_2.jpg"]	f	contain
382	Friedrich Nietzsche	Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (/ˈniːtʃə/ or /ˈnitʃi/; German: [ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈvɪlhɛlm ˈniːt͡sʃə]; 15 October 1844 – 25 August 1900) was a German philologist, philosopher, cultural critic, poet and composer. He wrote several critical texts on religion, morality, contemporary culture, philosophy and science, displaying a fondness for metaphor, irony and aphorism.\nNietzsche's key ideas include the Apollonian/Dionysian dichotomy, perspectivism, the Will to Power, the "death of God", the Übermensch and eternal recurrence. One of the key tenets of his philosophy is the concept of "life-affirmation," which embraces the realities of the world in which we live over the idea of a world beyond. It further champions the creative powers of the individual to strive beyond social, cultural, and moral contexts. His radical questioning of the value and objectivity of truth has been the focus of extensive commentary, and his influence remains substantial, particularly in the continental philosophical schools of existentialism, postmodernism, and post-structuralism. His ideas of individual overcoming and transcendence beyond structure and context have had a profound impact on late-twentieth and early-twenty-first century thinkers, who have used these concepts as points of departure in the development of their philosophies.\nNietzsche began his career as a classical philologist — a scholar of Greek and Roman textual criticism — before turning to philosophy. In 1869, at age twenty-four, he was appointed to the Chair of Classical Philology at the University of Basel, the youngest individual to have held this position. He resigned in the summer of 1879 due to health problems that plagued him most of his life. In 1889, at age forty-four, he suffered a collapse and a complete loss of his mental faculties. The breakdown was later ascribed to atypical general paresis due to tertiary syphilis, but this diagnosis has come into question. Re-examination of Nietzsche's medical evaluation papers show that he almost certainly died of brain cancer. Nietzsche lived his remaining years in the care of his mother until her death in 1897, after which he fell under the care of his sister Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche until his death in 1900.\nAs his caretaker, his sister assumed the roles of curator and editor of Nietzsche's manuscripts. Förster-Nietzsche was married to a prominent German nationalist and antisemite, Bernhard Förster, and reworked Nietzsche's unpublished writings to fit her own ideology, often in ways contrary to Nietzsche's stated opinions, which were strongly and explicitly opposed to antisemitism and nationalism (see Nietzsche's criticism of antisemitism and nationalism). Through Förster-Nietzsche's editions, Nietzsche's name became associated with German militarism and Nazism, although later twentieth-century scholars have counteracted this conception of his ideas.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bb/Nietzsche-munch.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Nietzsche187a.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Nietzsche1861.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/NietzscheHouseTurin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Nietzsche187c.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Nietzsche_paul-ree_lou-von-salome188.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Nietzsche_Archives_in_Weimar.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Portrait_of_Friedrich_Nietzsche.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/People_icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Socrates.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Rohde_Gersdorff_Nietzsche.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Frankfurt_Am_Main-Portraits-Arthur_Schopenhauer-1845.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Flag_of_Saxony.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Friedrich_Nietzsche_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Friedrich_Nietzsche-1872.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/1864c.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Eh-dm-27.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Atheism_template.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Nietzsche-Stein_01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Friedrich_Nietzsche_drawn_by_Hans_Olde.jpg"]	f	cover
409	Frank Lloyd Wright	Frank Lloyd Wright (born Frank Lincoln Wright, June 8, 1867 – April 9, 1959) was an American architect, interior designer, writer and educator, who designed more than 1000 structures and completed 532 works. Wright believed in designing structures which were in harmony with humanity and its environment, a philosophy he called organic architecture. This philosophy was best exemplified by his design for Fallingwater (1935), which has been called "the best all-time work of American architecture". Wright was a leader of the Prairie School movement of architecture and developed the concept of the Usonian home, his unique vision for urban planning in the United States.\nHis work includes original and innovative examples of many different building types, including offices, churches, schools, skyscrapers, hotels, and museums. Wright also designed many of the interior elements of his buildings, such as the furniture and stained glass. Wright authored 20 books and many articles and was a popular lecturer in the United States and in Europe. His colorful personal life often made headlines, most notably for the 1914 fire and murders at his Taliesin studio. Already well known during his lifetime, Wright was recognized in 1991 by the American Institute of Architects as "the greatest American architect of all time."	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lloyd_Wright	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Wikinews-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/William_H._Winslow_House_Front_Facade.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Wrightfallingwater.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Taliesin-aerial-600.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Taliesin600.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Taliesinpan.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Weltzheimer_Johnson_House_2010.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Frank_Lloyd_Wright_portrait.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Frank_Lloyd_Wright_LC-USZ62-36384.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Guggenheim_museum_exterior.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Frank_W._Thomas_House_%281901%29%2C_210_Forest_Avenue%2C_Oak_Park%2C_IL.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Nathan_G._Moore_house_%281895%29%2C_Oak_Park%2C_IL%2C_rear.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Imperial_Hotel_FFW_1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Price_tower.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Oak_Park_Il_Walter_Gale_House4.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Robie_House.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/RobieHouseWindows_ChicagoIL.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/FLW_Beth_Sholom_exterior.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Design_portal_logo.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/FrankLloydWright1966USstamp.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/FLW_Gammage_Auditorium_ASU_Tempe_AZ_20154.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/2010-04-10_3000x2000_oakpark_nathan_g_moore_house.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Darwin_D._Martin_House.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Arthur_Heurtley_House_%281902%29%2C_Oak_Park%2C_IL.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Frank_Lloyd_Wright_Home_and_Studio_%28west_side_zoom%29.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Frank_LLoyd_Wright_Studio_Chicago_Frontage.jpg"]	f	cover
375	Cubism	Cubism is an early-20th-century avant-garde art movement pioneered by Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso, joined by Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay, Henri Le Fauconnier, Fernand Léger and Juan Gris that revolutionized European painting and sculpture, and inspired related movements in music, literature and architecture. Cubism has been considered the most influential art movement of the 20th century. The term is broadly used in association with a wide variety of art produced in Paris (Montmartre, Montparnasse and Puteaux) during the 1910s and extending through the 1920s. Variants such as Futurism and Constructivism developed in other countries.\nA primary influence that led to Cubism was the representation of three-dimensional form in the late works of Paul Cézanne, which were displayed in a retrospective at the 1907 Salon d'Automne. In Cubist artwork, objects are analyzed, broken up and reassembled in an abstracted form—instead of depicting objects from one viewpoint, the artist depicts the subject from a multitude of viewpoints to represent the subject in a greater context.	\N	\N	\N	http://lh5.ggpht.com/_cAJW5JRJ2CI/TMAuIxcGpGI/AAAAAAAAAMY/Gj70JU8FNN0/s1242/parascan-cubism.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubism	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c5/Albert_Gleizes%2C_before_1913%2C_detail_of_photograph_from_Les_Peintre_Cubists%2C_1913%2C_Guillaume_Apollinaire_copy.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3c/Violin_and_Candlestick.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d1/Picasso_three_musicians_moma_2006.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/82/Albert_Gleizes%2C_l%27Homme_au_Balcon%2C_1912%2C_oil_on_canvas%2C_195.6_x_114.9_cm%2C_Philadelphia_Museum_of_Art.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8f/Pablo_Picasso%2C_1909-10%2C_Figure_dans_un_Fauteuil_%28Seated_Nude%2C_Femme_nue_assise%29%2C_oil_on_canvas%2C_92.1_x_73_cm%2C_Tate_Modern%2C_London.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Palace_of_Assembly_Chandigarh_2006.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4c/Les_Demoiselles_d%27Avignon.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Metzinger%2C_Nu_%C3%A0_la_chemin%C3%A9e_%28Nu%29%2C_1910%2C_Salon_d%27Automne%2C_Les_Peintre_Cubist%2C_Apollinaire_published_1913.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b5/Pablo_Picasso%2C_1909%E2%80%9310%2C_Head_of_a_Woman_%28Fernande%29%2C_modeled_on_Fernande_Olivier_%28right_side%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f7/Raymond_Duchamp_Villon%2C_La_Maison_Cubiste%2C_Projet_d%27Hotel_%28Cubist_House%29%2C_in_Les_Peintres_Cubistes%2C_Guillaume_Apollinaire%2C_17_March_1913%2C_Maison_Figuiers_et_Cie.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Z%C3%BCrich_-_Seefeld_-_Corbusier_-_Heidi_Weber_Museum_IMG_1552.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_163.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/21/Pablo_Picasso%2C_1909%E2%80%9310%2C_Head_of_a_Woman_%28Fernande%29%2C_modeled_on_Fernande_Olivier.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Wikinews-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Robert_Delaunay%2C_1912%2C_Les_Fen%C3%AAtres_simultan%C3%A9e_sur_la_ville_%28Simultaneous_Windows_on_the_City%29%2C_40_x_46_cm%2C_Kunsthalle_Hamburg.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Jean_Metzinger%2C_photo_published_in_1913.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Pablo_picasso_1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Juan_Gris_-_Portrait_of_Pablo_Picasso_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f8/Jean_Metzinger%2C_1911-12%2C_La_Femme_au_Cheval_-_The_Rider.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg"]	f	cover
376	Pablo Picasso	Pablo Ruiz y Picasso, known as Pablo Picasso (Spanish: [ˈpaβlo piˈkaso]; 25 October 1881 – 8 April 1973) was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist, stage designer, poet and playwright who spent most of his adult life in France. As one of the greatest and most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed sculpture, the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907), and Guernica (1937), a portrayal of the German bombing of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War.\nPicasso, Henri Matisse and Marcel Duchamp are regarded as the three artists who most defined the revolutionary developments in the plastic arts in the opening decades of the 20th century, responsible for significant developments in painting, sculpture, printmaking and ceramics.\nPicasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent in his early years, painting in a realistic manner through his childhood and adolescence. During the first decade of the 20th century, his style changed as he experimented with different theories, techniques, and ideas. His work is often categorised into periods. While the names of many of his later periods are debated, the most commonly accepted periods in his work are the Blue Period (1901–1904), the Rose Period (1904–1906), the African-influenced Period (1907–1909), Analytic Cubism (1909–1912), and Synthetic Cubism (1912–1919).\nExceptionally prolific throughout the course of his long life, Picasso achieved universal renown and immense fortune for his revolutionary artistic accomplishments, and became one of the best-known figures in 20th-century art.	\N	\N	\N	http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-A82qvKDJTEY/US023OU6_II/AAAAAAAAACA/MukR4kixAoQ/s1600/girl-before-a-mirror.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/23/Pablo_Picasso%2C_1901-02%2C_Femme_au_caf%C3%A9_%28Absinthe_Drinker%29%2C_oil_on_canvas%2C_73_x_54_cm%2C_Hermitage_Museum%2C_Saint_Petersburg%2C_Russia.jpg",

388	Treaty of Versailles	The Treaty of Versailles (French: Traité de Versailles) was one of the peace treaties at the end of World War I. It ended the state of war between Germany and the Allied Powers. It was signed on 28 June 1919, exactly five years after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. The other Central Powers on the German side of World War I were dealt with in separate treaties. Although the armistice, signed on 11 November 1918, ended the actual fighting, it took six months of negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference to conclude the peace treaty. The treaty was registered by the Secretariat of the League of Nations on 21 October 1919, and was printed in The League of Nations Treaty Series.\nOf the many provisions in the treaty, one of the most important and controversial required "Germany [to] accept the responsibility of Germany and her allies for causing all the loss and damage" during the war (the other members of the Central Powers signed treaties containing similar articles). This article, Article 231, later became known as the War Guilt clause. The treaty forced Germany to disarm, make substantial territorial concessions, and pay reparations to certain countries that had formed the Entente powers. In 1921 the total cost of these reparations was assessed at 132 billion Marks (then $31.4 billion or £6.6 billion, roughly equivalent to US $442 billion or UK £284 billion in 2014). At the time economists, notably John Maynard Keynes predicted that the treaty was too harsh—a "Carthaginian peace", and said the figure was excessive and counter-productive. The historian Sally Marks judged the reparation figure to be lenient, a sum that was designed to look imposing but was in fact not, that had little impact on the German economy and analysed the treaty as a whole to be quite restrained and not as harsh as it could have been.\nThe result of these competing and sometimes conflicting goals among the victors was a compromise that left none contented: Germany was not pacified or conciliated, nor permanently weakened. The problems that arose from the treaty would lead to the Locarno Treaties, which improved relations between Germany and the other European Powers, and the renegotiation of the reparation system resulting in the Dawes Plan, the Young Plan, and the indefinite postponement of reparations at the Lausanne Conference of 1932.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-R01213%2C_Versailles%2C_deutsche_Verhandlungdelegation.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/William_Orpen_-_The_Signing_of_Peace_in_the_Hall_of_Mirrors%2C_Versailles.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Small_Flag_of_the_United_Nations_ZP.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/German_losses_after_WWI.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Mass_demonstration_in_front_of_the_Reichstag_against_the_Treaty_of_Versailles.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Flag_of_Uruguay.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Flag_of_the_Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Flag_of_the_Republic_of_China_1912-1928.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Fokker_Dr._I_%28117710246%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Flag_of_Peru_%281825_-_1950%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Flag_of_Portugal.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Flag_of_Thailand.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/12/Flag_of_Poland.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Flag_of_Greece_%281822-1978%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Flag_of_Germany_%283-2_aspect_ratio%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Flag_of_Haiti_%28civil%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Flag_of_Guatemala.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Flag_of_Honduras.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Flag_of_Hejaz_1917.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Flag_of_Liberia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Flag_of_Italy_%281861-1946%29_crowned.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Flag_of_Panama.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Flag_of_Nicaragua.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Wikinews-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/US_flag_48_stars.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Treaty_of_Versailles%2C_English_version.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Rhineland.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Merchant_flag_of_Japan_%281870%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Flag_of_Bolivia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Flag_of_Belgium_%28civil%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Flag_of_Cuba.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Flag_of_Brazil_%281889-1960%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Armisticebrestlitovsk.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-R01213%2C_Versailles%2C_deutsche_Verhandlungdelegation.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Bundesarchiv_Bild_146-1972-081-03%2C_Zerlegen_eines_schweren_Gesch%C3%BCtzes.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Flag_of_Ecuador.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Flag_of_Czechoslovakia.svg"]	f	cover
396	Mahatma Gandhi	Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (pronounced [ˈmoːɦənd̪aːs ˈkərəmtʃənd̪ ˈɡaːnd̪ʱi] ( ); 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was the preeminent leader of Indian nationalism in British-ruled India. Employing nonviolent civil disobedience, Gandhi led India to independence and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahatma (Sanskrit: "high-souled", "venerable")—applied to him first in 1914 in South Africa,—is now used worldwide. He is also called Bapu (Gujarati: endearment for "father", "papa") in India.\nBorn and raised in a Hindu, merchant caste, family in coastal Gujarat, western India, and trained in law at the Inner Temple, London, Gandhi first employed nonviolent civil disobedience as an expatriate lawyer in South Africa, in the resident Indian community's struggle for civil rights. After his return to India in 1915, he set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination. Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, but above all for achieving Swaraj or self-rule.\nGandhi famously led Indians in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi) Dandi Salt March in 1930, and later in calling for the British to Quit India in 1942. He was imprisoned for many years, upon many occasions, in both South Africa and India. Gandhi attempted to practise nonviolence and truth in all situations, and advocated that others do the same. He lived modestly in a self-sufficient residential community and wore the traditional Indian dhoti and shawl, woven with yarn hand spun on a charkha. He ate simple vegetarian food, and also undertook long fasts as means of both self-purification and social protest.\nGandhi's vision of a free India based on religious pluralism, however, was challenged in the early 1940s by a new Muslim nationalism which was demanding a separate Muslim homeland carved out of India. Eventually, in August 1947, Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two dominions, a Hindu-majority India and Muslim Pakistan. As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs made their way to their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the Punjab and Bengal. Eschewing the official celebration of independence in Delhi, Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to provide solace. In the months following, he undertook several fasts unto death to promote religious harmony. The last of these, undertaken on 12 January 1948 at age 78, also had the indirect goal of pressuring India to pay out some cash assets owed to Pakistan. Some Indians thought Gandhi was too accommodating. Among them was Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist, who assassinated Gandhi on 30 January 1948 by firing three bullets into his chest at point-blank range.\nGandhi is commonly, though not officially, considered the Father of the Nation in India. His birthday, 2 October, is commemorated there as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday, and world-wide as the International Day of Nonviolence.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Young_India.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Marche_sel.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Mohandas_Karamchand_Gandhi_pronunciation.oga", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Portrait_Gandhi.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/MKGandhi_assassination_spot.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Mahadev_Desai_and_Gandhi_2_1939.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Mahatmagandhi.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Gandhi_spinning.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Gandhi_suit.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Gandi_bista_Novi_Beograd.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/God_is_Truth.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/41/Flag_of_India.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Wikiversity-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Gandhi_Memorial_Kanyakumari.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Gandhi_Kheda_1918.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Gandhi_Tolstoy_Farm.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Gandhi_South-Africa.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Gandhi_and_Kasturbhai_1902.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Gandhi_and_Indira_1924.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Gandhi_at_Darwen_with_women.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Gandhi_and_Nehru_1942.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Gandhi_signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Gandhi_home.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/USSR_stamp_M.Gandi_1969_6k.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Tagore_Gandhi.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Socrates.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Salt_March.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Portrait_Gandhi.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/P_derecho.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Mountbattens_with_Gandhi_%28IND_5298%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Conscience_and_law.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Bust_of_Mahatma_Gandhi%2C_Saughton_Park%2C_Edinburgh_%281997%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Flag_of_the_Indian_National_Congress.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Emblem_of_India.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/1931_Flag_of_India.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Young_Gandhi.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/BlackFlagSymbol.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/Aum_red.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Gandhi_Jinnah_1944.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Gandhi_Graffiti_San_Francisco.jpg"]	f	cover
426	Normandy landings	The Normandy landings, codenamed Operation Neptune, were the landing operations of the Allied invasion of Normandy, in Operation Overlord, during World War II. The landings commenced on Tuesday, 6 June 1944 (D-Day), beginning at 6:30 am British Double Summer Time (GMT+2). In planning, as for most Allied operations, the term D-Day was used for the day of the actual landing, which was dependent on final approval.\nThe landings were conducted in two phases: an airborne assault landing of 24,000 British, US and Canadian airborne troops shortly after midnight, and an amphibious landing of Allied infantry and armoured divisions on the coast of France starting at 6:30 am. Surprise was achieved thanks to inclement weather and a comprehensive deception plan implemented in the months before the landings, codenamed Operation Bodyguard, to distract German attention from the possibility of landings in Normandy. A key success was to convince Adolf Hitler that the landings would actually occur to the north at the Pas-de-Calais. There were also decoy operations taking place simultaneously with the landings under the codenames Operation Glimmer and Operation Taxable to distract German forces from the real landing areas.\nSupreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces was General Dwight D. Eisenhower while overall command of ground forces (21st Army Group) was given to General Bernard Montgomery. The operation, planned by a team under Lieutenant-General Frederick Morgan, was the largest amphibious invasion in world history and was executed by land, sea and air elements under direct Anglo-American command with over 160,000 soldiers landing on 6 June 1944: 73,000 Americans, 61,715 British and 21,400 Canadians. 195,700 Allied naval and merchant navy personnel in over 5,000 ships were also involved. The invasion required the transport of soldiers and materiel from England by troop-laden aircraft and ships, the assault landings, air support, naval interdiction of the English Channel and naval gunfire support. The landings took place along a 50-mile (80 km) stretch of the Normandy coast divided into five sectors: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0a/Canadianoperationsondday.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/dd/Wikivoyage-Logo-v3-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/State_Flag_of_Greece_%281863-1924_and_1935-1970%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/State_Flag_of_Greece_%281863-1924_and_1935-1970%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Normandy_landings.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Operation_Neptune%2C_June_1944.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Paratrooper_about_to_jump_into_combat_on_1944-6-6.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Infantry_waiting_to_move_off_%27Queen_White%27_Beach.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Knockeoutpanzer.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Lci-convoy.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Normandy5.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/D-Day5.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/12/Flag_of_Poland.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Into_the_Jaws_of_Death_23-0455M_edit.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Flag_of_Belgium_%28civil%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Flag_of_Basse-Normandie.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Flag_of_Free_France_1940-1944.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Flag_of_Czechoslovakia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Flag_of_New_Zealand.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Flag_of_German_Reich_%281935%E2%80%931945%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Flag_of_Norway.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Heinkel_He_111_during_the_Battle_of_Britain.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/HMS_Lawford_1944_IWM_A_21817.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/65/Canada_JunoBeach_1_RCNCOMMANDO.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b9/Flag_of_Australia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Wikinews-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/US_flag_48_stars.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/US_Navy_081110-N-5549O-080_The_U.S._national_flag_waves_graciously_from_the_Iwo_Jima_memorial_during_a_wreath_laying_ceremony_in_honor_of_the_233rd_Marine_Corps_birthday_at_the_Marine_Corps_War_Memorial.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Beny-sur-Mer_Cemetery.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Flag_of_Basse-Normandie.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Canadian_Red_Ensign_1921-1957.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Bundesarchiv_Bild_146-2004-0176%2C_Normandie%2C_zerst%C3%B6rter_englischer_Lastensegler.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Allied_Invasion_Force.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Atlantikwall.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/American_assault_troops_at_Omaha_Beach_02.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/FTP-p012904.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Cimeti%C3%A8re_allemand_de_La_Cambe_-_pano.jpg"]	f	cover
453	Andy Warhol	Andy Warhol (/ˈwɔrhɒl/; August 6, 1928 – February 22, 1987) was an American artist who was a leading figure in the visual art movement known as pop art. His works explore the relationship between artistic expression, celebrity culture and advertisement that flourished by the 1960s. After a successful career as a commercial illustrator, Warhol became a renowned and sometimes controversial artist. The Andy Warhol Museum in his native city, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, holds an extensive permanent collection of art and archives. It is the largest museum in the United States dedicated to a single artist.\nWarhol's art encompassed many forms of media, including hand drawing, painting, printmaking, photography, silk screening, sculpture, film, and music. He was also a pioneer in computer-generated art using Amiga computers that were introduced in 1984, two years before his death. He founded Interview Magazine and was the author of numerous books, including The Philosophy of Andy Warhol and Popism: The Warhol Sixties. He is also notable as a gay man who lived openly as such before the gay liberation movement. His studio, The Factory, was a famous gathering place that brought together distinguished intellectuals, drag queens, playwrights, Bohemian street people, Hollywood celebrities, and wealthy patrons.\nWarhol has been the subject of numerous retrospective exhibitions, books, and feature and documentary films. He coined the widely used expression "15 minutes of fame". Many of his creations are very collectible and highly valuable. The highest price ever paid for a Warhol painting is US$105 million for a 1963 canvas titled "Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster)". A 2009 article in The Economist described Warhol as the "bellwether of the art market". Warhol's works include some of the most expensive paintings ever sold.\n\n	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/95/Warhol-Campbell_Soup-1-screenprint-1968.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Warhol	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/WarholaHousePittsburgh.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Bratislava_Venturska_ulica1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Ballerina-icon.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Jimmy_Carter_Andy_Warhol_1977.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Andy_Warhol_and_Tennessee_Williams_NYWTS.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9c/WarholLastSup.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Andy_Warhol_by_Jack_Mitchell.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Andy_Warhol_and_Ulli_Lommel_on_set_of_Cocaine_Cowboys.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Warhol%27s_grave.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Pittsburgh_city_coat_of_arms.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/95/Warhol-Campbell_Soup-1-screenprint-1968.jpg"]	f	cover
416	Duke Ellington	Edward Kennedy "Duke" Ellington (April 29, 1899 – May 24, 1974) was an American composer, pianist and bandleader of jazz orchestras. His career spanned over 50 years, leading his orchestra from 1923 until he died.\nThough widely considered to have been a pivotal figure in the history of jazz, Ellington himself embraced the phrase "beyond category" as a "liberating principle", and referred his music to the more general category of "American Music", rather than to a musical genre such as "jazz". Born in Washington, D.C., he was based in New York City from the mid-1920s, and gained a national profile through his orchestra's appearances at the Cotton Club. In the 1930s they toured in Europe.\nSome of the musicians who were members of Ellington's orchestra, such as saxophonist Johnny Hodges, are still, in their own right, considered to be among the best players in jazz, but it was Ellington who melded them into the best-known jazz orchestral unit in the history of jazz. Several members of the orchestra remained members for several decades. A master at writing miniatures for the three-minute 78 rpm record format, Ellington often composed specifically for the style and skills of his individual musicians, such as "Jeep's Blues" for Hodges, and "Concerto for Cootie" for trumpeter Cootie Williams, which later became "Do Nothing Till You Hear from Me" with Bob Russell's lyrics.\nOften collaborating with others, Ellington originated over a thousand compositions and his extensive oeuvre is the largest recorded personal jazz legacy, with many of his extant works having become standards. Ellington also recorded songs written by his bandsmen, for example Juan Tizol's "Caravan", and "Perdido", which brought Spanish tinge to big-band jazz.\nAfter 1941, Ellington collaborated with composer-arranger-pianist Billy Strayhorn, whom he called his "writing and arranging companion". With Strayhorn, he composed many extended compositions, or 'suites', as well as further shorter pieces. Following an appearance at the Newport Jazz Festival, Rhode Island in July 1956, he enjoyed a major career revival and, with his orchestra, embarked on world tours. Ellington recorded for most American record companies of his era at some point, and appeared in several films, scoring several, and composed stage musicals.\nDue to his inventive use of the orchestra, or big-band, and thanks to his eloquence and charisma, he is generally considered to have elevated the perception of jazz to an art form on a par with other traditional genres of music. His reputation increased after his death and he was awarded a special Pulitzer Prize in 1999.\nGunther Schuller wrote in 1989: "Ellington composed incessantly to the very last days of his life. Music was indeed his mistress; it was his total life and his commitment to it was incomparable and unalterable. In jazz he was a giant among giants. And in twentieth century music, he may yet one day be recognized as one of the half-dozen greatest masters of our time."	\N	\N	\N	http://www.examiner.com/images/blog/wysiwyg/image/Duke_ellington_cdaja5573.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Ellington	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Richard_Nixon_and_Duke_Ellington_1969.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Jazz_musician_Duke_Ellington.JPEG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Duke_Ellington_St._Louis_Toodle-Oo.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Duke_Ellington_Grave_1024.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Duke_Ellington_in_ons_land.ogv", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Duke_Ellington_at_the_Hurricane_Club_1943.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/2009_DC_Proof.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Duke_Ellington_1.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Duke_Ellington_-_publicity.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/James_Stewart-Duke_Ellington_in_Anatomy_of_a_Murder_trailer.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Duke_Ellington_star_HWF.JPG"]	f	90%
437	Korea	Korea (Korean: 한국; Hanja: 韓國), pronounced as Hanguk in South Korean and Chosŏn in North Korean, is an East Asian territory that is divided into two distinct sovereign states, North Korea and South Korea. Located on the Korean Peninsula, Korea is bordered by China to the northwest and Russia to the northeast. It is separated from Japan to the east by the Korea Strait and the Sea of Japan (East Sea); it is separated from Taiwan to the south by the East China Sea.\nThe adoption of the Chinese writing system ("Hanja" in Korean) in the 2nd century BC and the introduction of Buddhism in the 4th century AD had profound effects on the Three Kingdoms of Korea, which was first united during the Silla (57 BC – AD 935) under the King Munmu. The united Silla fell to Goryeo in 935 at the end of the Later Three Kingdoms. Goryeo was a highly cultured state and created the Jikji in the 14th century. The invasions by the Mongolians in the 13th century, however, greatly weakened the nation, which was forced to become a tributary state. After the Mongol Empire's collapse, severe political strife followed. The Ming-allied Joseon emerged supreme in 1388.\nThe first 200 years of Joseon were marked by relative peace and saw the creation of the Korean Hangul alphabet by King Sejong the Great in the 14th century and the increasing influence of Confucianism. During the later part of the dynasty, however, Korea's isolationist policy earned it the Western nickname of the "Hermit kingdom". By the late 19th century, the country became the object of the colonial designs by Japan. In 1910, Korea was annexed by Japan and remained a colony until the end of World War II in August 1945.\nIn 1945, the Soviet Union and the United States agreed on the surrender of Japanese forces in Korea in the aftermath of World War II, leaving Korea partitioned along the 38th parallel, with the north under Soviet occupation and the south under U.S. occupation. These circumstances soon became the basis for the division of Korea by the two superpowers, exacerbated by their inability to agree on the terms of Korean independence. The two Cold War rivals then established governments centered around their own respective ideologies, leading to Korea's division into two political entities: North Korea and South Korea.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/Korea_Map.svg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Taegukgi.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Korean_sword_dance-Jinju_geommu-03.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/March_1st_movement.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Korean_book-Jikji-Selected_Teachings_of_Buddhist_Sages_and_Seon_Masters-1377.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Korea-Gyeongju-Bulguksa-33.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Hunmin_jeong-eum.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Korea_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Korea-Jejudo-Coast-03.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Korea_south_kangnung_kyongpodae.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/Korea_Map.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/KoreanWar_recover_Seoul.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Korean.Seoraksan-Ulsanbawi-01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Korean_cuisine-Bibimbap-08.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Korean_book-Jikji-Selected_Teachings_of_Buddhist_Sages_and_Seon_Masters-1377.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/dd/Wikivoyage-Logo-v3-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6b/Terrestrial_globe.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Flag_of_North_Korea.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Daedongyeojijeondo_small.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Goryeo_Buddhist_painting.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Flag_of_South_Korea.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Anapji_Pond-Gyeongju-Korea-2006-09.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Daedongyeojijeondo_small.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Asia_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Hangugeo-Chosonmal.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Gyeongbok-gung_palace-05_%28xndr%29.jpg"]	f	60%
445	Albert Camus	Albert Camus (French: [albɛʁ kamy] ( ); 7 November 1913 – 4 January 1960) was a French Nobel Prize winning author, journalist, and philosopher. His views contributed to the rise of the philosophy known as absurdism. He wrote in his essay "The Rebel" that his whole life was devoted to opposing the philosophy of nihilism while still delving deeply into individual and sexual freedom.\nAlthough often cited as a proponent of existentialism, the philosophy with which Camus was associated during his own lifetime, he rejected this particular label. In an interview in 1945, Camus rejected any ideological associations: "No, I am not an existentialist. Sartre and I are always surprised to see our names linked...".\nCamus was born in French Algeria to a Pied-Noir family. He studied at the University of Algiers, where he was goalkeeper for the university association football team, until he contracted tuberculosis in 1930. In 1949, Camus founded the Group for International Liaisons within the Revolutionary Union Movement after his split with Garry Davis's Citizens of the World movement. The formation of this group, according to Camus, was intended to "denounce two ideologies found in both the USSR and the USA" regarding their idolatry of technology.\nCamus was awarded the 1957 Nobel Prize for Literature "for his important literary production, which with clear-sighted earnestness illuminates the problems of the human conscience in our times".	\N	\N	\N	http://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/authors/1323630564p5/957894.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Camus_Monument_in_Villeblevin_France_17-august-2003.4.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Camus_Monument_in_Villeblevin_France_17-august-2003.1.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Open_book_nae_French_flag.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/20041113-002_Lourmarin_Tombstone_Albert_Camus.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Albert_Camus.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Albert_Camus%2C_gagnant_de_prix_Nobel%2C_portrait_en_buste%2C_pos%C3%A9_au_bureau%2C_faisant_face_%C3%A0_gauche%2C_cigarette_de_tabagisme.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ed/Nobel_Prize.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Split-arrows.svg"]	f	contain
479	Thomas Jefferson	Thomas Jefferson (April 13 [O.S. April 2] 1743 – July 4, 1826) was an American Founding Father, the principal author of the Declaration of Independence (1776) and the third President of the United States (1801–1809). He was a spokesman for democracy, embraced the principles of republicanism and the rights of man with worldwide influence. At the beginning of the American Revolution, he served in the Continental Congress, representing Virginia and then served as a wartime Governor of Virginia (1779–1781). Just after the war ended, from mid-1784 Jefferson served as a diplomat, stationed in Paris. In May 1785, he became the United States Minister to France.\nJefferson was the first United States Secretary of State (1790–1793) serving under President George Washington. In opposition to Alexander Hamilton's Federalism, Jefferson and his close friend, James Madison, organized the Democratic-Republican Party, and subsequently resigned from Washington's cabinet. Elected Vice President in 1796, when he came in second to President John Adams of the Federalists, Jefferson opposed Adams and with Madison secretly wrote the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, which attempted to nullify the Alien and Sedition Acts.\nElected president in what Jefferson called the Revolution of 1800, he oversaw the purchase of the vast Louisiana Territory from France (1803), and sent the Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804–1806) to explore the new west. Jefferson is considered a primary architect of American expansionism; the United States having doubled in size during his presidency. His second term was beset with troubles at home, such as the failed treason trial of his former Vice President Aaron Burr. With escalating trouble with Britain who was challenging American neutrality and threatening shipping at sea, he tried economic warfare with his embargo laws which only damaged American trade. In 1803, President Jefferson initiated a process of Indian tribal removal and relocation to the Louisiana Territory west of the Mississippi River, in order to open lands for eventual American settlers. In 1807 he drafted and signed into law a bill banning the importation of slaves into the United States.\nA leader in the Enlightenment, Jefferson was a polymath who spoke five languages and was deeply interested in science, invention, architecture, religion and philosophy and was an active member and eventual president of the American Philosophical Society. These interests led him to the founding of the University of Virginia after his presidency. He designed his own large mansion on a 5,000 acre plantation near Charlottesville, Virginia, which he named Monticello and the University of Virginia building. While not a notable orator, Jefferson was a skilled writer and corresponded with many influential people in America and Europe throughout his adult life.\nAfter Martha Jefferson, his wife of eleven years, died in 1782, Jefferson kept his promise to her that he would never remarry. Their marriage had produced six children, of whom two survived to adulthood.\nAs long as he lived, Jefferson expressed opposition to slavery, yet, he owned hundreds of slaves and freed only a few of them. Since his own day, controversy has ensued over allegations that he fathered children by his slave, Sally Hemings; DNA tests in 1998, together with historical research, suggest he fathered at least one. Although he has been criticized by many present-day scholars over the issues of racism and slavery, Jefferson remains rated as one of the greatest U.S. presidents.	\N	\N	\N	http://d24pgnwzlizq37.cloudfront.net/images/stories/Thomas_Jefferson_picture.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Us_declaration_independence.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Thomas_Jefferson_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Thomas_Jefferson_by_Rembrandt_Peale%2C_1800.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/TJB_Lined_Cover.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/ThomasJeffersonByRobertField.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Thomas_Jefferson%27s_Grave_Site.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Thomas_Jefferson_1786_by_Mather_Brown.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Seal_Of_The_President_Of_The_United_States_Of_America.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Seal_of_Virginia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Sound-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Gilbert_Stuart_Williamstown_Portrait_of_George_Washington.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Jefferson_Memorial_with_Declaration_preamble.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Jefferson_3.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Jefferson_slaves.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Jefferson_Portrait_West_Point_by_Thomas_Sully.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Lewis_and_Clark_Expidition_Map.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Johnadamsvp.flipped.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/National-atlas-1970-1810-loupurchase-1.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Monticello_2010-10-29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Ograbme.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Office-book.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3f/Capture_of_La_Prevoyante_and_La_Raison.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/University-of-Virginia-Rotunda.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/US_Vice_President_Seal.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/USSConstellationVsInsurgente.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Thomas_Jefferson_by_Rembrandt_Peale_1805_cropped.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Jefferson%27s%2Bdeskdetail.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Flag_of_the_United_States_Secretary_of_State.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Jefferson2_1856_Die_Proof-5c.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Jefferson%2C_Thomas_%28signature_on_check%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/1800_map_Afrique_by_Arrowsmith_BPL_15210_detail2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/FirstBankofUS00_crop.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/1818_letter_Jefferson_to_Mordecai_Noah.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Jefferson_2.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Jefferson_1.ogg"]	f	60%
400	Roaring Twenties	The Roaring Twenties is a term sometimes used to refer to the 1920s in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, characterizing the decade's distinctive cultural edge in New York City, Chicago, Paris, Berlin, London, Los Angeles and many other major cities during a period of sustained economic prosperity. French speakers called it the "années folles" ("Crazy Years"), emphasizing the era's social, artistic, and cultural dynamism. Normalcy returned to politics in the wake of hyper-emotional patriotism after World War I, jazz music blossomed, the flapper redefined modern womanhood, and Art Deco peaked. Economically, the era saw the large-scale diffusion and use of automobiles, telephones, motion pictures, and electricity, unprecedented industrial growth, accelerated consumer demand and aspirations, and significant changes in lifestyle and culture. The media focused on celebrities, especially sports heroes and movie stars, as cities rooted for their home team and filled the new palatial cinemas and gigantic stadiums. In most major countries women won the right to vote for the first time. Finally the Wall Street Crash of 1929 ended the era, as the Great Depression set in worldwide, bringing years of worldwide gloom and hardship.\nThe social and cultural features known as the Roaring Twenties began in leading metropolitan centers, especially Chicago, New Orleans, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, Paris and London, then spread widely in the aftermath of World War I. The United States gained dominance in world finance. Thus when Germany could no longer afford war reparations to Britain, France and other Allies, the Americans came up with the Dawes Plan and Wall Street invested heavily in Germany, which repaid its reparations to nations that in turn used the dollars to pay off their war debts to Washington. By the middle of the decade, prosperity was widespread, with the second half of the decade later becoming known as the "Golden Twenties".\nThe spirit of the Roaring Twenties was marked by a general feeling of discontinuity associated with modernity and a break with traditions. Everything seemed to be feasible through modern technology. New technologies, especially automobiles, moving pictures and radio proliferated "modernity" to a large part of the population. Formal decorative frills were shed in favor of practicality in both daily life and architecture. At the same time, jazz and dancing rose in popularity, in opposition to the mood of the specter of World War I. As such, the period is also often referred to as the Jazz Age.	\N	\N	\N	http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WaxuhhfkZtQ/T2x7OFBlQiI/AAAAAAAAATk/oEO6HVSI20E/s400/001rkthb.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roaring_Twenties	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Save_a_Little_Dram_for_Me.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Trumpet01.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/WeMustGrowAMustache.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Chrysler_Building_at_night.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Gdp20-40.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Felix-pace.jpg"]	f	cover
420	Allies	In everyday English usage, allies are people, groups, or states that have joined in an association for mutual benefit or to achieve some common purpose, whether or not explicit agreement has been worked out between them. When the term is used in the context of war or armed struggle, such associations may also be called allied powers, especially when discussing World War I or World War II.\nA formal military alliance is not required for being perceived as an ally—co-belligerence, fighting alongside someone, is enough. According to this usage, allies become so not when concluding an alliance treaty but when struck by war.\nWhen spelled with a capital "A", the word "Allies" usually denotes the countries who fought together against the Central Powers in World War I (the Allies of World War I), or those who fought against the Axis Powers in World War II (the Allies of World War II). The term has also been used by the United States Army to describe the countries that gave assistance to the South Vietnam during the Vietnam War.\nMore recently, the term "Allied forces" has also been used to describe the coalition of the Gulf War, as opposed to forces the Multi-National Forces in Iraq which are commonly referred to as "Coalition forces" or, as by the George W. Bush administration, "the coalition of the willing".\nThe Allies in World War I (also known as the Entente Powers) were initially the British Empire, France, the Russian Empire, Belgium, Serbia, Montenegro and Japan, joined later by Italy, Portugal, Romania, the United States, Greece and Brazil. Some, such as the Russian Empire, withdrew from the war before the armistice due to revolution or defeat by the Central Powers.\n\n	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Childe_Hassam_-_Allies_Day.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Allies_at_the_Brandenburg_Gate%2C_1945.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Icon_vojn.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Childe_Hassam_-_Allies_Day.jpg"]	f	cover
446	Fantasy	Fantasy is a genre of fiction that commonly uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary plot element, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in imaginary worlds where magic and magical creatures are common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.\nIn popular culture, the fantasy genre is predominantly of the medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings and related books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense, however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.\nFantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture.	\N	\N	\N	http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PrbX0iQ6K8I/TCIleMoPZsI/AAAAAAAAAKI/6eNDa5qCnVw/s1600/Fantasy-15.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Dobryna.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/The_Enchanted_Garden_of_Messer_Ansaldo_by_Marie_Spartali_Stillman_%281889%29.jpg"]	t	cover
449	C. S. Lewis	Clive Staples Lewis (29 November 1898 – 22 November 1963), commonly called C. S. Lewis and known to his friends and family as "Jack", was a novelist, poet, academic, medievalist, literary critic, essayist, lay theologian, and Christian apologist. Born in Belfast, Ireland, he held academic positions at both Oxford University (Magdalen College), 1925–1954, and Cambridge University (Magdalene College), 1954–1963. He is best known both for his fictional work, especially The Screwtape Letters, The Chronicles of Narnia, and The Space Trilogy, and for his non-fiction Christian apologetics, such as Mere Christianity, Miracles, and The Problem of Pain.\nLewis and fellow novelist J. R. R. Tolkien were close friends. Both authors served on the English faculty at Oxford University, and both were active in the informal Oxford literary group known as the "Inklings". According to his memoir Surprised by Joy, Lewis had been baptized in the Church of Ireland (part of the Anglican Communion) at birth, but fell away from his faith during his adolescence. Owing to the influence of Tolkien and other friends, at the age of 32 Lewis returned to the Anglican Communion, becoming "a very ordinary layman of the Church of England". His faith had a profound effect on his work, and his wartime radio broadcasts on the subject of Christianity brought him wide acclaim.\nIn 1956, he married the American writer Joy Davidman, 17 years his junior, who died four years later of cancer at the age of 45. Lewis died three years after his wife, from renal failure, one week before his 65th birthday. Media coverage of his death was minimal; he died on 22 November 1963—the same day that U.S. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, and the same day another famous author, Aldous Huxley, died. This has led to the date of his death often being overshadowed by that of Kennedy. In 2013, on the 50th anniversary of his death, Lewis was honoured with a memorial in Poets' Corner, Westminster Abbey.\nLewis's works have been translated into more than 30 languages and have sold millions of copies. The books that make up The Chronicles of Narnia have sold the most and have been popularized on stage, TV, radio, and cinema. His works entered the public domain in 2014 in countries where copyright expires 50 years after the death of the creator, such as Canada.	\N	\N	\N	http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BS2Jbmc53TY/UTN5Le8ePmI/AAAAAAAAAUk/RgyKeNRLQks/s1600/C.S%2BLewis.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Statue_of_C.S._Lewis%2C_Belfast.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Sound-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1e/C.s.lewis3.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/38/Little_Lea.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/MagdalenCollegeOxford20040613_CopyrightKaihsuTai.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/En-CSLewis.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Mourne_mountains.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/MagdaleneCollegeCam.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/CSLewisPlaque.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Eagle_and_Child.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/CSLewismural.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Narnia_aslan.jpg"]	f	60%
386	Woodrow Wilson	Thomas Woodrow Wilson (December 28, 1856 – February 3, 1924) was the 28th President of the United States, in office from 1913 to 1921. A leader of the Progressive Movement, he served as President of Princeton University from 1902 to 1910, and then as the Governor of New Jersey from 1911 to 1913. With the Republican Party split in 1912, he led his Democratic Party to control both the White House and Congress for the first time in nearly two decades.\nIn his first term as President, Wilson persuaded a Democratic Congress to pass a legislative agenda that few presidents have equaled, remaining unmatched up until the New Deal in 1933. This agenda included the Federal Reserve Act, Federal Trade Commission Act, the Clayton Antitrust Act, the Federal Farm Loan Act and an income tax. Child labor was curtailed by the Keating–Owen Act of 1916, but the U.S. Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in 1918. Wilson also had Congress pass the Adamson Act, which imposed an 8-hour workday for railroads. Although considered a modern liberal visionary giant as President, Wilson was "deeply racist in his thoughts and politics" and his administration racially segregated federal employees and the Navy. According to Wilson biographer A. Scott Berg, author of Wilson, an 815-page biography; "No matter what time you lived, some of the things Wilson said and did were racist. That being said, I do think that for his day, he was a centrist. He was not some wild Klansman. I think he was sympathetic to African Americans. He just, for all sorts of reasons, didn't think the nation was ready to segregate." Narrowly re-elected in 1916 around the slogan "He kept us out of war", Wilson's second term was dominated by American entry into World War I. While American non-interventionist sentiment was strong, American neutrality was challenged in early 1917 when the German Empire began unrestricted submarine warfare despite repeated strong warnings and tried to enlist Mexico to attack the U.S. and intimated they would assist in taking back the territories comprising Texas, Arizona and New Mexico; discovered upon decryption of the Zimmermann Telegram a message between German leaders and their Embassy in Mexico. Barbara W. Tuchman, a Pulitzer Prize-winning American historian, says the Zimmermann telegram was the "final straw" on the matter of war for President Wilson.\nIn April 1917, Wilson asked Congress to declare war in order to make "the world safe for democracy." During the war, Wilson focused on diplomacy and financial considerations, leaving the waging of the war itself primarily in the hands of the Army. On the home front in 1917, he began the United States' first draft since the American Civil War; borrowed billions of dollars in war funding through the newly established Federal Reserve Bank and Liberty Bonds; set up the War Industries Board; promoted labor union cooperation; supervised agriculture and food production through the Lever Act; took over control of the railroads; and gave a well-known Flag Day speech that fueled the wave of anti-German sentiment sweeping the country. Wilson also suppressed anti-war movements with the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918, a crackdown which broadened and intensified to include real and suspected anarchists and communists during the First Red Scare of 1919–1920. After years of opposition, Wilson was pressured to change his position on women's suffrage in 1918, which he advocated as a war measure.\nIn the late stages of the war, Wilson took personal control of negotiations with Germany, including the armistice. In 1918, he issued his Fourteen Points, his view of a post-war world that could avoid another terrible conflict. In 1919, he went to Paris to aid the formation of a League of Nations to the Treaty of Versailles, with special attention on creating new nations out of defunct empires. During an intense fight with Henry Cabot Lodge and the Republican-controlled Senate over giving the League of Nations power to force the U.S. into a war, Wilson suffered a severe stroke that left his wife largely in control of the White House until he left office in March 1921. Despite his poor health, he was able to block any compromises that would enable the Senate to ratify the Treaty of Versailles, and attempted to run for a third term. No leading Democrat wanted Wilson to run again—he was still bedridden, and growing increasingly unpopular amid isolationist backlash against the League and a postwar depression. The Democrats were further weakened in 1920 by the defection of traditional Irish and German Democrats over Wilson's war policies, and Wilson's delayed embrace of women's suffrage in comparison to Republican candidate Warren G. Harding. With Wilson unpopular, Harding promised a "a return to normalcy" and was elected in an unprecedented popular vote landslide in 1920. Wilson was too ill to leave Washington when his term ended, and he died there in 1924.\nAn intellectual with a mastery of political language, Wilson was a highly effective partisan campaigner as well as legislative strategist. His biographer Arthur Link says, "He was a virtuoso and a spellbinder during a time when the American people admired oratory above all other political skills. But as a spellbinder he appealed chiefly to men's minds and spirits, and only infrequently to their passions." A Presbyterian of deep religious faith, Wilson appealed to a gospel of service and infused a profound sense of moralism into his idealistic internationalism, now referred to as "Wilsonian". Wilsonianism calls for the United States to enter the world arena to fight for democracy, and has been a contentious position in American foreign policy. For his sponsorship of the League of Nations, Wilson was awarded the 1919 Nobel Peace Prize.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Woodrow_Wilson_1925_Issue-17c.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Woodrow_Wilson_video_montage.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Woodrow_Wilson_tomb_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/WilsonFirstInauguration.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Wilson_Cabinet_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Wilson%2C_PA_Keystone_Marker.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Wilson-quote-in-birth-of-a-nation.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/US100000dollarsbillobverse.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/US_64th_regiment_celebrate_the_Armistice.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/WWilson1stBall1916.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/30/Wilson_-_Address_to_the_American_Indians_edit.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ed/Nobel_Prize.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Brandeisl.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Woodrow_and_Edith_Wilson2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/President_Woodrow_Wilson_asking_Congress_to_declare_war_on_Germany%2C_2_April_1917.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Postcard21000SoldiersCreateImageofPresidentWilsonCampShermanOH1918-commons.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Pu-prospect-house.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/President_Woodrow_Wilson_portrait_December_2_1912.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Seal_Of_The_President_Of_The_United_States_Of_America.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Pump1913.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Seal_of_New_Jersey.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Thomas_Woodrow_Wilson%2C_Harris_%26_Ewing_bw_photo_portrait%2C_1919.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/The_First_World_War_1914_-_1918-_United_States_of_America-_Personalities_Q58363.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Woodrow_Wilson_by_Pach_Bros_c1875.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Woodrow_Wilson_at_a_parade%2C_1918.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Woodrow_Wilson_addressing_Congress_%28LOC%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Woodrow_Wilson_Signature_2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Woodrow_Wilson_1925_Issue-17c.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Woodrow_Wilson_1902_cph.3b11773.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Woodrow_Wilson%2C_accepting_Democratic_nomination%2C_1916.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/WoodrowWilsonVersailles.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Women_workers_in_ordnance_shops%2C_Midvale_Steel_and_Ordnance_Company%2C_Nicetown%2C_Pennsylvania._Hand_chipping_with_pneumati_-_NARA_-_530774.tif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Wilsonspiercearrow.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/FoodWillWinTheGreatWarNOLA.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Fokker_Dr._I_%28117710246%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Great_Seal_of_the_United_States_%28obverse%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/5_U.S._Wolfhounds_on_parade_in_Vladavostock%2C_August_1918.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Yellow_flag_waving.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Flag_of_New_Jersey.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Big_four.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/01/A_coloured_voting_box.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Nuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg"]	f	cover
422	Battle of Britain	The Battle of Britain (German: Luftschlacht um England, literally "Air battle for England") is the name given to the Second World War air campaign waged by the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) against the United Kingdom during the summer and autumn of 1940. The name is derived from a famous speech delivered by Prime Minister Winston Churchill in the House of Commons: "... the Battle of France is over. I expect that the Battle of Britain is about to begin."\nThe Battle of Britain was the first major campaign to be fought entirely by air forces, and was also the largest and most sustained aerial bombing campaign to that date. The German objective was to gain air superiority over the Royal Air Force (RAF), especially Fighter Command. From July 1940, coastal shipping convoys and shipping centres, such as Portsmouth, were the main targets; one month later, the Luftwaffe shifted its attacks to RAF airfields and infrastructure. As the battle progressed, the Luftwaffe also targeted aircraft factories and ground infrastructure. Eventually the Luftwaffe resorted to attacking areas of political significance and using terror bombing strategy.\nBy preventing Germany from gaining air superiority, the battle ended the threat that Hitler would launch Operation Sea Lion, an amphibious and airborne invasion of Britain. The failure of Germany to achieve its objectives of destroying Britain's air defences, or forcing Britain to negotiate an armistice or an outright surrender, is considered its first major defeat and a crucial turning point in the Second World War.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Piloci_303.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Britain	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/43/Douglas_Bader.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/RAF_roundel.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Spitfires_camera_gun_film_shows_tracer_ammunition.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Piloci_303.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/RAFBristolBlenheimWWIIColour.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/RAF_Bomber_Command_1940_HU104658.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/RAF_Fighter_Command_1940_HU104450.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Flag_of_Italy_%281861-1946%29_crowned.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Flag_of_New_Zealand.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Heinkel_He_111_during_the_Battle_of_Britain.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Messerschmitt_Bf_109E.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9f/Bombing_of_London.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Bundesarchiv_Bild_146-1987-121-30A%2C_Hugo_Sperrle.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Bundesarchiv_Bild_146-1969-094-18%2C_Dornier_Do_17_und_Supermarine_Spitfire.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Canadian_Red_Ensign_1921-1957.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Bundesarchiv_Bild_146-2006-0123%2C_Adolf_Galland.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Dywizjon_303_4.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Churchill_portrait_NYP_45063_edit1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Flag_of_Czechoslovakia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Ensign_of_the_Royal_Air_Force.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Flag_of_Italy_%281861-1946%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Flag_of_German_Reich_%281935%E2%80%931945%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b9/Flag_of_Australia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5e/Goering_giving_a_speech_to_his_fighter_pilots_near_Calais_September_1940.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/12/Flag_of_Poland.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Wikinews-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Battle_of_britain_firefighting.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Battle_of_britain_air_observer.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/British_and_German_aircraft_a_dog_fight.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Boulton_Paul_Defiant.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/19sqdn-spit1-1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Battle_of_Britain_map.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/602sqdn-spit1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Bundesarchiv_Bild_141-0678%2C_Flugzeuge_Heinkel_He_111.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Bundesarchiv_Bild_102-13805%2C_Hermann_G%C3%B6ring.jpg"]	f	cover
427	Battle of the Bulge	The Battle of the Bulge (16 December 1944 – 25 January 1945) was a major German offensive campaign launched through the densely forested Ardennes region of Wallonia in Belgium, France and Luxembourg on the Western Front toward the end of World War II in Europe. The surprise attack caught the Allied forces completely off guard and became the costliest battle in terms of casualties for the United States, whose forces bore the brunt of the attack. It also severely depleted Germany's war-making resources.\nThe battle was known by different names. The Germans referred to it as Unternehmen Wacht am Rhein ("Operation Watch on the Rhine"), while the French named it the Bataille des Ardennes ("Battle of the Ardennes"). The Allies called it the Ardennes Counteroffensive. The phrase "Battle of the Bulge" was coined by contemporary press to describe the way the Allied front line bulged inward on wartime news maps and became the best known name for the battle.\nThe German offensive was supported by several subordinate operations known as Unternehmen Bodenplatte, Greif, and Währung. Germany's goal for these operations was to split the British and American Allied line in half, capture Antwerp, and then proceed to encircle and destroy four Allied armies, forcing the Western Allies to negotiate a peace treaty in the Axis Powers' favour. Once that was accomplished, Hitler could fully concentrate on the eastern theatre of war.\nThe offensive was planned with the utmost secrecy, minimizing radio traffic and moving troops and equipment under cover of darkness. The Third U.S. Army's intelligence staff predicted a major German offensive, and Ultra indicated that a "substantial and offensive" operation was expected or "in the wind", although a precise date or point of attack could not be given. Aircraft movement from the Russian Front and transport of forces by rail, both to the Ardennes, was noticed but not acted upon, according to a report later written by Peter Calvocoressi and F. L. Lucas at the codebreaking centre Bletchley Park.\nNear-complete surprise was achieved by a combination of Allied overconfidence, preoccupation with Allied offensive plans, and poor aerial reconnaissance. The Germans attacked a weakly defended section of the Allied line, taking advantage of heavily overcast weather conditions, which grounded the Allies' overwhelmingly superior air forces. Fierce resistance on the northern shoulder of the offensive around Elsenborn Ridge and in the south around Bastogne blocked German access to key roads to the northwest and west that they counted on for success; columns that were supposed to advance along parallel routes found themselves on the same roads. This and terrain that favoured the defenders threw the German advance behind schedule and allowed the Allies to reinforce the thinly placed troops. Improved weather conditions permitted air attacks on German forces and supply lines, which sealed the failure of the offensive. In the wake of the defeat, many experienced German units were left severely depleted of men and equipment, as survivors retreated to the defenses of the Siegfried Line.\nThe battle involved about 610,000 American men, of whom some 89,000 were casualties, including 19,000 killed. It was the largest and bloodiest battle fought by the United States in World War II.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/British_Sherman_Firefly_Namur.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Bulge	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/37/6th_Armored_Division_in_Belgium_1945.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Wikinews-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Mardasson_Memorial_Bastogne.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/P41%28map%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/US_flag_48_stars.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Western_Front_Ardennes_1944.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/German_Wacht_Am_Rhein_Offensive_Plan.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/German_soldier_Ardennes_1944.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Infantry_near_Bastogne.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Malmedy_Massacre.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Wacht_am_Rhein_map_%28Opaque%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-J28619%2C_Ardennenoffensive%2C_gefangene_Amerikaner.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-J28589%2C_Kriegsgefangene_amerikanische_Soldaten.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/DeadBelgiumcivilians1944.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Canadian_Red_Ensign_1921-1957.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Flag_of_Belgium_%28civil%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Dwight_D._Eisenhower_as_General_of_the_Army_crop.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Flag_of_German_Reich_%281935%E2%80%931945%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Flag_of_Free_France_1940-1944.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/GERMAN_TROOPS_ADVANCING_PAST_ABANDONED_AMERICAN_EQUIPMENT.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Flag_of_Luxembourg.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5e/US_engineers_Luxembourg_1945.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Battle_of_the_Bulge_7th.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Battle_of_the_Bulge_6th.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Bernard_Law_Montgomery.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Battle_of_the_Bulge_progress.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/117th_Infantry_North_Carolina_NG_at_St._Vith_1945.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Battle_of_the_Bulge_5th.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/82nd_Grave.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-1985-0104-501%2C_Ardennenoffensive%2C_Grenadiere_in_Luxemburg.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/British_Sherman_Firefly_Namur.jpg"]	f	cover

394	Benito Mussolini	Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini (Italian pronunciation: [beˈnito musoˈlini]; 29 July 1883 – 28 April 1945) was an Italian politician, journalist, and leader of the National Fascist Party, ruling the country as Prime Minister from 1922 until his ousting in 1943. He ruled constitutionally until 1925, when he dropped all pretense of democracy and set up a legal dictatorship. Known as Il Duce ("the leader"), Mussolini was one of the key figures in the creation of fascism.\nOriginally a member of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), Mussolini was expelled from the PSI due to his opposition to the party's stance on neutrality in World War I. Mussolini denounced the PSI, and later founded the fascist movement. Following the March on Rome in October 1922 he became the youngest Prime Minister in Italian history until the appointment of Matteo Renzi on February 2014. After destroying all political opposition through his secret police and outlawing labor strikes, Mussolini and his fascist followers consolidated their power through a series of laws that transformed the nation into a one-party dictatorship. Within five years he had established dictatorial authority by both legal and extraordinary means, aspiring to create a totalitarian state. Mussolini remained in power until he was deposed by King Victor Emmanuel III in 1943. A few months later, he became the leader of the Italian Social Republic, a German client regime in northern Italy; he held this post until his death in 1945.\nSince 1939, Mussolini had sought to delay a major war in Europe until at least 1942. Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, starting World War II. On 10 June 1940, Mussolini sided with Germany, though he was aware that Italy did not have the military capacity in 1940 to carry out a long war with France and the United Kingdom. Mussolini believed that after the imminent French surrender, Italy could gain territorial concessions from France and then he could concentrate his forces on a major offensive in Egypt, where British and Commonwealth forces were outnumbered by Italian forces. However the UK refused to accept German proposals for a peace that would involve accepting Germany's victories in Eastern and Western Europe, plans for a German invasion of the UK did not proceed, and the war continued.\nOn 24 July 1943, soon after the start of the Allied invasion of Italy, Mussolini was defeated in the vote at the Grand Council of Fascism, and the King had him arrested the following day. On 12 September 1943, Mussolini was rescued from prison in the Gran Sasso raid by German special forces. In late April 1945, with total defeat looming, Mussolini attempted to escape north, only to be quickly captured and summarily executed near Lake Como by Italian partisans. His body was then taken to Milan where it was hung upside down at a service station for public viewing and to provide confirmation of his demise.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Bundesarchiv_Bild_101I-316-1181-11%2C_Italien%2C_Benito_Mussolini_mit_italienischen_Soldaten.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/03/Flag_of_Italy.svg",

442	Berlin Wall	The Berlin Wall (German: Berliner Mauer) was a barrier constructed by the German Democratic Republic (GDR, East Germany) starting on 13 August 1961, that completely cut off (by land) West Berlin from surrounding East Germany and from East Berlin. The barrier included guard towers placed along large concrete walls, which circumscribed a wide area (later known as the "death strip") that contained anti-vehicle trenches, "fakir beds" and other defenses. The Eastern Bloc claimed that the wall was erected to protect its population from fascist elements conspiring to prevent the "will of the people" in building a socialist state in East Germany. In practice, the Wall served to prevent the massive emigration and defection that marked Germany and the communist Eastern Bloc during the post-World War II period.\nThe Berlin Wall was officially referred to as the "Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart" (German: Antifaschistischer Schutzwall) by GDR authorities, implying that neighbouring West Germany had not been fully de-Nazified. The West Berlin city government sometimes referred to it as the "Wall of Shame"—a term coined by mayor Willy Brandt—while condemning the Wall's restriction on freedom of movement. Along with the separate and much longer Inner German border (IGB), which demarcated the border between East and West Germany, it came to symbolize the "Iron Curtain" that separated Western Europe and the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War.\nBefore the Wall's erection, 3.5 million East Germans circumvented Eastern Bloc emigration restrictions and defected from the GDR, many by crossing over the border from East Berlin into West Berlin, from where they could then travel to West Germany and other Western European countries. Between 1961 and 1989, the wall prevented almost all such emigration. During this period, around 5,000 people attempted to escape over the wall, with an estimated death toll of over 100 in and around Berlin, although that claim is disputed.\nIn 1989, a series of radical political changes occurred in the Eastern Bloc, associated with the liberalization of the Eastern Bloc's authoritarian systems and the erosion of political power in the pro-Soviet governments in nearby Poland and Hungary. After several weeks of civil unrest, the East German government announced on 9 November 1989 that all GDR citizens could visit West Germany and West Berlin. Crowds of East Germans crossed and climbed onto the wall, joined by West Germans on the other side in a celebratory atmosphere. Over the next few weeks, a euphoric public and souvenir hunters chipped away parts of the wall; the governments later used industrial equipment to remove most of the rest. The physical Wall itself was primarily destroyed in 1990. The fall of the Berlin Wall paved the way for German reunification, which was formally concluded on 3 October 1990.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Berlinermauer.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/23/Exterior_of_East_Berlin_Neue_Zeit_newspaper%2C_with_Berlin_Wall_in_foreground.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/db/East_Berlin_Death_Strip_seen_from_Axel_Springer_Building_1984.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/92/Conrad-schumann.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Fort_Gordon%27s_Berlin_Wall_Display.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Ich_bin_ein_Berliner_Speech_%28June_26%2C_1963%29_John_Fitzgerald_Kennedy_trimmed.theora.ogv", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Tear_down_this_wall.ogv", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Crane_removed_part_of_Wall_Brandenburg_Gate.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/EasternBloc_BasicMembersOnly.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Flag_of_East_Berlin_%281956-1990%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Flag_of_East_Germany.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-1989-1110-018%2C_Berlin%2C_Checkpoint_Charlie%2C_Nacht_des_Mauerfalls.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-1990-0105-029%2C_Berlin%2C_Loch_in_Mauer_am_Reichstag.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-85458-0002%2C_Berlin%2C_Mauerbau%2C_Kampfgruppen_am_Brandenburger_Tor.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Checkpoint_Charlie_Memorial.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Jfk_berlin_address_high.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e6/Road_sign_delimiting_British_zone_of_occupation_in_Berlin_1984.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Berlin_Wall_segment_in_Los_Angeles.webm", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Berlin_Wall_from_the_East.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Berlin_satellite_image_with_Berlin_wall.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Berlin_fallofwall_emerson.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Berlin_wall-3.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Berlin_wall-1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Berlin_wall_1990.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Berlin_wall_1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Berlinermauer.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Berlin_wall_at_Potsdamer_Platz_March_2009.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Juggling_on_the_Berlin_Wall_1a.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/West_and_East_Berlin.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Warsaw_Pact_Logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Thefalloftheberlinwall1989.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Structure_of_Berlin_Wall.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Mauerspecht_1989.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Kennedy_in_Berlin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Karte_berliner_mauer_en.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/BerlinWall-BrandenburgGate.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Berlin-wall-map.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Berlin_Wall_%2813-8-2006%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Berlin_-_You_are_leaving.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Audio-input-microphone.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Berlin-Memorial_to_the_Victims_of_the_Wall-1982.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/BERLINER_WALL_1.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f5/Berlin_travel_orders.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Berlin_Wall_death_strip%2C_1977.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Berlin_Wall_1961-11-20.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/df/BERLINER_MAUER_1961%E2%80%931989_plaque.jpg"]	f	cover
107	Bill of Rights 1689	The Bill of Rights is an Act of the Parliament of England passed on 16 December 1689. It was a restatement in statutory form of the Declaration of Right presented by the Convention Parliament to William and Mary in March 1689 (or 1688 by Old Style dating), inviting them to become joint sovereigns of England. It lays down limits on the powers of the crown and sets out the rights of Parliament and rules for freedom of speech in Parliament, the requirement for regular elections to Parliament and the right to petition the monarch without fear of retribution. It reestablished the liberty of Protestants to have arms for their defence within the rule of law, and condemned James II of England for "causing several good subjects being Protestants to be disarmed at the same time when papists were both armed and employed contrary to law".\nThese ideas about rights reflected those of the political thinker John Locke and they quickly became popular in England. It also sets out—or, in the view of its drafters, restates—certain constitutional requirements of the Crown to seek the consent of the people, as represented in Parliament.\nIn the United Kingdom, the Bill of Rights is further accompanied by the Magna Carta, the Petition of Right, the Habeas Corpus Act 1679, the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, the Human Rights Act 1998 and the Equality Act 2010 as some of the basic documents of the uncodified British constitution. A separate but similar document, the Claim of Right Act, applies in Scotland. The Bill of Rights (1688 or 1689) was one of the inspirations for the United States Bill of Rights.\nAlong with the Act of Settlement 1701, the Bill of Rights is still in effect in all Commonwealth realms. It is one of the main constitutional laws governing the royal succession. Since the implementation of the Statute of Westminster 1931, the Bill of Rights cannot be altered without the consent of every realm.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Coat_of_Arms_of_England_%281689-1694%29.svg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_Rights_1689	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Coat_of_Arms_of_England_%281689-1694%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/People_icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/English_Bill_of_Rights_of_1689.jpg"]	f	cover
460	American Revolution	In this article, inhabitants of the Thirteen Colonies who supported the American Revolution are primarily referred to as "Americans" or "Patriots," and sometimes as "Whigs," "Rebels" or "Revolutionaries." Colonists who supported the British side are called "Loyalists" or "Tories". In accordance with the policy of this encyclopedia, this article uses American English terminology; in British English these events are known as the "American War of Independence".\n\nThe American Revolution was a political upheaval, 1765–1783, as the Thirteen American Colonies broke from the British Empire and formed an independent nation, the United States of America. Starting in 1765 the Americans rejected the authority of Parliament to tax them without elected representation; protests escalated as in the Boston Tea Party of 1773, and the British imposed punitive laws on Massachusetts in 1774. In 1774 the Patriots suppressed the Loyalists and expelled all royal officials. Each colony now had a new government that took control. The British responded by sending combat troops to re-establish royal control. Through the Second Continental Congress, the Patriots fought the British in the American Revolutionary War from 1775 to 1783.\nThe British sent invasion armies and used their powerful navy to blockade the coast. First Continental Congress delegate and former Virginia militia soldier George Washington became the Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, working with Congress and the states to raise armies and neutralize the influence of Loyalists. While precise proportions are not known, about 40% of the colonists were Patriots, 20% were Loyalists and the rest were neutral or kept quiet. Claiming British rule was tyrannical and violated the rights of Englishmen, the Patriots used the political philosophy of republicanism to reject monarchy and aristocracy, and proclaim that all men are created equal. Congress declared independence in July 1776, when Thomas Jefferson wrote and the Congress unanimously approved the United States Declaration of Independence. The colonies now became states, and Congress rejected British proposals for compromise that would keep them under the king. The British were forced out of Boston in 1776, but then captured and held New York City for the duration of the war, nearly capturing General Washington and his army. The British blockaded the ports and captured other cities for brief periods, but 90% of the people were in rural areas.\nIn early 1778, after an invading army from Canada was captured by the Americans, the French entered the war as allies of the United States. The naval and military power of the two sides was about equal, and France had allies in the Netherlands and Spain, while Britain had no major allies in this large-scale war. The war turned to the South, where the British captured an American army at South Carolina, but failed to enlist enough volunteers from Loyalist civilian to take effective control. A combined American–French force captured a second British army at Yorktown in 1781, effectively ending the war in the United States. A peace treaty in 1783 confirmed the new nation's complete separation from the British Empire. The United States took possession of nearly all the territory east of the Mississippi River and south of the Great Lakes, with the British retaining control of Canada and Spain taking Florida.\nThe American Revolution was the result of a series of social, political, and intellectual transformations in American society, government and ways of thinking. Among the significant results of the revolution was the creation of a democratically-elected representative government responsible to the will of the people.\nThe period after the peace treaty came in 1783 involved debates between nationally-minded men like Washington who wanted a strong national government, and local leaders who wanted strong states but a weak national government. The former group won out the ratification of a new United States Constitution in 1788. It replaced the weaker Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union. The new Constitution established a relatively strong federal national government that included a strong elected president, national courts, a bicameral Congress that represented both states in the Senate and population in the House of representatives. Congress had powers of taxation that were lacking under the old Articles. The United States Bill of Rights of 1791 comprised the first ten amendments to the Constitution, guaranteeing many "natural rights" that were influential in justifying the revolution, and attempted to balance a strong national government with strong state governments and broad personal liberties. The American shift to liberal republicanism, and the gradually increasing democracy, caused an upheaval of traditional social hierarchy and gave birth to the ethic that has formed a core of political values in the United States.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Benjamin_Franklin_-_Join_or_Die.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Mobbing_the_Tories_-_Project_Gutenberg_eText_16960.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Benjamin_Franklin_-_Join_or_Die.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Commonsense.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Boston_Tea_Party_Currier_colored.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/J_S_Copley_-_Samuel_Adams.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Gaspee_Affair.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Abigail_Adams.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/RapeBoston.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Benjamin_Rush_Painting_by_Peale_1783.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/American_revolution_bicentennial.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Yorktown80.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Declaration_independence.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Map_of_territorial_growth_1775.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Johannes_Adam_Simon_Oertel_Pulling_Down_the_Statue_of_King_George_III%2C_N.Y.C._ca._1859.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Us_unabhaengigkeitskrieg.jpg"]	f	cover
124	Aria	An aria (Italian for air; plural: arie, or arias in common usage, diminutive form arietta) in music was originally any expressive melody, usually, but not always, performed by a singer. The term became used almost exclusively to describe a self-contained piece for one voice, with or without orchestral accompaniment, normally part of a larger work. The typical context for arias is opera, but vocal arias also feature in oratorios and cantatas, sharing features of the operatic arias of their periods.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Tamerlano_-_Bajazet-Aria.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aria	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Christoph_Willibald_Gluck_painted_by_Joseph_Duplessis.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Tamerlano_-_Bajazet-Aria.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Goldberg-titlepage.png"]	f	cover
443	Red Scare	A Red Scare is the promotion of fear of a potential rise of communism or radical leftism, used by anti-leftist proponents.

The Second Red Scare was focused on national and foreign communists influencing society, infiltrating the federal government, or both.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Joseph_McCarthy.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Scare	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Sound-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e9/Red_Scare.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Palmer_Bombing.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Joseph_McCarthy.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Come_unto_me%2C_ye_opprest.jpg"]	f	70%
228	Boston Massacre	The Boston Massacre, known as the Incident on King Street by the British,[citation needed] was an incident on March 5, 1770, in which British Army soldiers killed five male civilians and injured six others. British troops had been stationed in Boston, capital of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, since 1768 in order to protect and support crown-appointed colonial officials attempting to enforce unpopular Parliamentary legislation. Amid ongoing tense relations between the population and the soldiers, a mob formed around a British sentry, who was subjected to verbal abuse and harassment. He was eventually supported by eight additional soldiers, who were subjected to verbal threats and thrown objects. They fired into the crowd, without orders, instantly killing three people and wounding others. Two more people died later of wounds sustained in the incident.\nThe crowd eventually dispersed after Acting Governor Thomas Hutchinson promised an inquiry, but reformed the next day, prompting the withdrawal of the troops to Castle Island. Eight soldiers, one officer, and four civilians were arrested and charged with murder. Defended by the lawyer and future American President, John Adams, six of the soldiers were acquitted, while the other two were convicted of manslaughter and given reduced sentences. The men found guilty of manslaughter were sentenced to branding on their hand. Depictions, reports, and propaganda about the event, notably the colored engraving produced by Paul Revere (shown at right), further heightened tensions throughout the Thirteen Colonies.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/BostonMassacre_byAlonzoChappel1878.png	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Massacre	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Boston_massacre_grave_20040930_105414_1.627x1068.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Boston_Massacre_Memorial_-_IMG_9560.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Flag_of_Boston.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/2009_BostonMassacre_site_3658174192.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Boston_Massacre%2C_03-05-1770_-_NARA_-_518262.tif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/BostonMassacre_byAlonzoChappel1878.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Boston_Massacre_high-res.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/USA-Massacre_Site0.jpg"]	f	cover
229	Boston Tea Party	The Boston Tea Party (initially referred to by John Adams as "the Destruction of the Tea in Boston") was a political protest by the Sons of Liberty in Boston, on December 16, 1773. Disguised as American Indians, the demonstrators destroyed an entire shipment of tea, which had been sent by the East India Company, in defiance of the Tea Act of May 10, 1773. They boarded the ships and threw the chests of tea into Boston Harbor, ruining the tea. The British government responded harshly and the episode escalated into the American Revolution. The Tea Party became an iconic event of American history, and other political protests such as the Tea Party movement after 2010 explicitly refer to it.\nThe Tea Party was the culmination of a resistance movement throughout British America against the Tea Act, which had been passed by the British Parliament in 1773. Colonists objected to the Tea Act because they believed that it violated their rights as Englishmen to "No taxation without representation," that is, be taxed only by their own elected representatives and not by a British parliament in which they were not represented. Protesters had successfully prevented the unloading of taxed tea in three other colonies, but in Boston, embattled Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.\nThe Boston Tea Party was a key event in the growth of the American Revolution. Parliament responded in 1774 with the Coercive Acts, or Intolerable Acts, which, among other provisions, ended local self-government in Massachusetts and closed Boston's commerce. Colonists up and down the Thirteen Colonies in turn responded to the Coercive Acts with additional acts of protest, and by convening the First Continental Congress, which petitioned the British monarch for repeal of the acts and coordinated colonial resistance to them. The crisis escalated, and the American Revolutionary War began near Boston in 1775.\n\n	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Boston_Tea_Party_Currier_colored.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Tea_Party	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Boston_Tea_Party_Museum.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Boston_Tea_Party_Currier_colored.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Boston_Tea_Party_w.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Boston_Tea_Party_Plaque_-_Independence_Wharf_2009.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/BostonTeaPartyJoyceNotice.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Boston_Tea_Party-Cooper.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Boston_Tea_Party-1973_issue-3c.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Flag_of_Boston.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Edenton-North-Carolina-women-Tea-boycott-1775.jpg"]	f	cover
222	Coda	A code is a rule for converting a piece of information (for example, a letter, word, phrase, or gesture) into another - usually shortened or covert - form or representation (one sign into another sign), not necessarily of the same type.\nIn communications and information processing, encoding is the process by which information from a source is converted into symbols to be communicated. Decoding is the reverse process, converting these code symbols back into information understandable by a receiver.\nOne reason for coding is to enable communication in places where ordinary plain language, spoken or written, is difficult or impossible. For example, semaphore, where the configuration of flags held by a signaller or the arms of a semaphore tower encodes parts of the message, typically individual letters and numbers. Another person standing a great distance away can interpret the flags and reproduce the words sent.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coda	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/International_Morse_Code.svg"]	t	cover
461	French Revolution	The French Revolution (French: Révolution française) was a period of radical social and political upheaval in France from 1789 to 1799 that profoundly affected French and modern history, marking the decline of powerful monarchies and churches and the rise of democracy and nationalism. Popular resentment of the privileges enjoyed by the clergy and aristocracy grew amidst an economic crisis following two expensive wars and years of bad harvests, motivating demands for change. These were couched in terms of Enlightenment ideals and caused the convocation of the Estates-General in May 1789. The first year of the Revolution saw members of the Third Estate proclaiming the Tennis Court Oath in June, the assault on the Bastille in July, the passage of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in August, and a march on Versailles that forced the royal court back to Paris in October. The next few years were dominated by struggles between various liberal assemblies and right-wing supporters of the monarchy intent on thwarting major reforms. A republic was proclaimed in September 1792 and King Louis XVI was executed the next year.\nExternal threats closely shaped the course of the Revolution. The Revolutionary Wars beginning in 1792 ultimately featured French victories that facilitated the conquest of the Italian Peninsula, the Low Countries and most territories west of the Rhine – achievements that had eluded previous French governments for centuries. Internally, popular agitation radicalized the Revolution significantly, culminating in the rise of Maximilien Robespierre and the Jacobins. The dictatorship imposed by the Committee of Public Safety during the Reign of Terror, from 1793 until 1794, caused up to 40,000 deaths inside France, abolished slavery in the colonies, and secured the borders of the new republic from its enemies. The Reign of Terror ended with the overthrow and execution of Robespierre and the other leading Jacobins in the Thermidorian Reaction. The Directory assumed control of the French state in 1795 and held power until 1799. In that year, conventionally seen as the conclusion of the Revolution, Napoleon Bonaparte overthrew the Directory in the coup of 18 Brumaire and established the Consulate. The First Empire under Napoleon emerged in 1804 and spread French revolutionary principles all over Europe during the Napoleonic Wars. The First Empire was militarily defeated by an anti-Napoleonic coalition that in 1815 brought about the restoration of the Bourbons, albeit under a constitutional monarchy, and the reversion to France's traditional frontiers.\nThe modern era has unfolded in the shadow of the French Revolution. French society itself underwent a transformation as feudal, aristocratic, and religious privileges disappeared and old ideas about tradition and hierarchy were abruptly overthrown under the mantra of "Liberté, égalité, fraternité". Globally, the Revolution accelerated the rise of republics and democracies, the spread of liberalism, nationalism, socialism and secularism, the development of modern political ideologies, and the practice of total war. Some of its central documents, like the Declaration of the Rights of Man, expanded the arena of human rights to include women and slaves.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Execution_robespierre%2C_saint_just....jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Prinsenvlag.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/Retour_Varennes_1791.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Marie-Olympe-de-Gouges.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/PWranitzkySymphOp31TheRevolutionOrLaPaixFuneralMarchForTheDeathofLouisXVI.OGG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/PWranitzkySymphOp31TheRevolutionOrLaPaixIntroduction.OGG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Heraldic_Royal_Crown_%28Common%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Jacques_Bertaux_-_Prise_du_palais_des_Tuileries_-_1793_.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/La_Marseillaise.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Le_Serment_du_Jeu_de_paume.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/62/PD-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Antoine-Fran%C3%A7ois_Callet_-_Louis_XVI%2C_roi_de_France_et_de_Navarre_%281754-1793%29%2C_rev%C3%AAtu_du_grand_costume_royal_en_1779_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Execution_of_Louis_XVI.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Estatesgeneral.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Federation.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Execution_robespierre%2C_saint_just....jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Flag_of_Spain_%281785-1873_and_1875-1931%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Flag_of_Prussia_1892-1918.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/France-500Livres-1790-uni.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/F%C3%AAte_de_l%27Etre_supr%C3%AAme_1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Women%27s_March_on_Versailles01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Troisordres.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/The_value_of_assignats%281789-1796%29.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Sans-culotte.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Bouchot_-_Le_general_Bonaparte_au_Conseil_des_Cinq-Cents.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/BatailleduMans1793.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen_in_1789.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Ch%C3%A9rieux_-_Club_des_femmes_patriotes_dans_une_%C3%A9glise_-_1793.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Anonymous_-_Prise_de_la_Bastille.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Bataille_de_Fleurus_1794.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Armoiries_r%C3%A9publique_fran%C3%A7aise.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Decret_de_l%27Assembl%C3%A9e_National_qui_supprime_les_Ordres_Religieux_et_Religieuses.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen_in_1789.jpg"]	f	cover
507	World War I	World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, was a global war centred in Europe that began on 28 July 1914 and lasted until 11 November 1918. From the time of its occurrence until the approach of World War II, it was called simply the World War or the Great War, and thereafter the First World War or World War I. In America, it was initially called the European War. More than 9 million combatants were killed; a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and tactical stalemate. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, paving the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.\nThe war drew in all the world's economic great powers, which were assembled in two opposing alliances: the Allies (based on the Triple Entente of the United Kingdom, France and the Russian Empire) and the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary. Although Italy had also been a member of the Triple Alliance alongside Germany and Austria-Hungary, it did not join the Central Powers, as Austria-Hungary had taken the offensive against the terms of the alliance. These alliances were both reorganised and expanded as more nations entered the war: Italy, Japan and the United States joined the Allies, and the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria the Central Powers. Ultimately, more than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history.\nAlthough a resurgence of imperialism was an underlying cause, the immediate trigger for war was the June 28, 1914 assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, by Yugoslav nationalist Gavrilo Princip in Sarajevo. This set off a diplomatic crisis when Austria-Hungary delivered an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia, and international alliances formed over the previous decades were invoked. Within weeks, the major powers were at war and the conflict soon spread around the world.\nOn July 28, the Austro-Hungarians fired the first shots in preparation for the invasion of Serbia. As Russia mobilised, Germany invaded neutral Belgium and Luxembourg before moving towards France, leading Britain to declare war on Germany. After the German march on Paris was halted, what became known as the Western Front settled into a battle of attrition, with a trench line that would change little until 1917. Meanwhile, on the Eastern Front, the Russian army was successful against the Austro-Hungarians, but was stopped in its invasion of East Prussia by the Germans. In November 1914, the Ottoman Empire joined the war, opening fronts in the Caucasus, Mesopotamia and the Sinai. Italy and Bulgaria went to war in 1915, Romania in 1916, and the United States in 1917.\nThe war approached a resolution after the Russian government collapsed in March, 1917, and a subsequent revolution in November brought the Russians to terms with the Central Powers. On November 4, 1918, the Austro-Hungarian empire agreed to an armistice. After a 1918 German offensive along the western front, the Allies drove back the Germans in a series of successful offensives and began entering the trenches. Germany, which had its own trouble with revolutionaries, agreed to an armistice on 11 November 1918, ending the war in victory for the Allies.\nBy the end of the war, four major imperial powers—the German, Russian, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires—ceased to exist. The successor states of the former two lost substantial territory, while the latter two were dismantled. The map of Europe was redrawn, with several independent nations restored or created. The League of Nations formed with the aim of preventing any repetition of such an appalling conflict. This aim failed, with weakened states, renewed European nationalism and the German feeling of humiliation contributing to the rise of fascism and the conditions for World War II.	\N	\N	\N	http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qgYS52GqNZM/UimCk7bt_1I/AAAAAAAAAEw/jIFfgUFkE3E/s1600/World-War-1.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg",

510	Great Depression	The Great Depression was a severe worldwide economic depression in the decade preceding World War II. The timing of the Great Depression varied across nations, but in most countries it started in 1930 and lasted until the late 1930s or middle 1940s. It was the longest, deepest, and most widespread depression of the 20th century.\nIn the 21st century, the Great Depression is commonly used as an example of how far the world's economy can decline. The depression originated in the U.S., after the fall in stock prices that began around September 4, 1929, and became worldwide news with the stock market crash of October 29, 1929 (known as Black Tuesday).\nThe Great Depression had devastating effects in countries rich and poor. Personal income, tax revenue, profits and prices dropped, while international trade plunged by more than 50%. Unemployment in the U.S. rose to 25%, and in some countries rose as high as 33%.\nCities all around the world were hit hard, especially those dependent on heavy industry. Construction was virtually halted in many countries. Farming and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by approximately 60%. Facing plummeting demand with few alternate sources of jobs, areas dependent on primary sector industries such as cash cropping, mining and logging suffered the most.\nSome economies started to recover by the mid-1930s. In many countries, the negative effects of the Great Depression lasted until after the end of World War II.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Lange-MigrantMother02.jpg/591px-Lange-MigrantMother02.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/WomanFactory1940s.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/UnemployedMarch.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Unemployed_men_queued_outside_a_depression_soup_kitchen_opened_in_Chicago_by_Al_Capone%2C_02-1931_-_NARA_-_541927.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Wpa1.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Graph_charting_income_per_capita_throughout_the_Great_Depression.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/GDP_depression.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Office-book.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Schwarzer_Freitag_Wien_1873.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Poor_mother_and_children%2C_Oklahoma%2C_1936_by_Dorothea_Lange.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/US_Farm_Prices_%281928-1935%29.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Tenantless_farm_Texas_panhandle_1938.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/US_Unemployment_1910-1960.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/US_GDP_10-60.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Lange-MigrantMother02.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Dust_Bowl_-_Dallas%2C_South_Dakota_1936.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Bundesarchiv_Bild_102-10246%2C_England%2C_Arbeitslose_vor_Gewerkschaftshaus.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Bank_of_the_United_States_failure_NYWTS.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/CCC_constructing_road.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Bundesarchiv_Bild_119-11-19-12%2C_Adolf_Hitler_bei_Ortsgruppenfeier_der_NSDAP_Rosenheim.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/1929_wall_street_crash_graph.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/American_union_bank.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/1930Industry.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Evictbonusarmy.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Crowd_outside_nyse.jpg"]	f	70%
258	French Directory	The Directory (French: Directoire) was a body of five directors that held executive power in France following the National Convention and preceding the Consulate. The period of this regime (2 November 1795 until 10 November 1799), commonly known as the Directory era, constitutes the second to last stage of the French Revolution.\nThe Directory era itself is further split into two periods, the First Directory and the Second Directory, divided by the Coup of 18 Fructidor. Directoire style refers to the Neoclassical styles in the decorative arts and fashion that characterize the period.\nThe directorial system of government was borrowed by several French client republics and is still used in modern Switzerland.\n\n	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/%C3%89lys%C3%A9e_blason.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Directory	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Portrait_de_madame_de_Verninac_by_David_Louvre_RF1942-16_n2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Prinsenvlag.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Armoiries_r%C3%A9publique_fran%C3%A7aise.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Flag_of_Spain_%281785-1873_and_1875-1931%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Flag_of_Prussia_1892-1918.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/%C3%89lys%C3%A9e_blason.jpg"]	f	cover
505	Era of Good Feelings	The Era of Good Feelings marked a period in the political history of the United States that reflected a sense of national purpose and a desire for unity among Americans in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars. The era saw the collapse of the Federalist Party and an end to the bitter partisan disputes between it and the dominant Democratic-Republican Party during the First Party System. President James Monroe endeavored to downplay partisan affiliation in making his nominations, with the ultimate goal of national unity and eliminating parties altogether from national politics. The period is so closely associated with Monroe's presidency (1817–1825) and his administrative goals that his name and the era are virtually synonymous.\nThe designation of the period by historians as one of "good feelings" is often conveyed with irony or skepticism, as the history of the era was one in which the political atmosphere was strained and divisive, especially among factions within the Monroe administration and the Republican Party.\nThe phrase Era of Good Feelings was coined by Benjamin Russell, in the Boston Federalist newspaper, Columbian Centinel, on July 12, 1817, following Monroe's visit to Boston, Massachusetts, as part of his good will tour of America.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Jolly_flatboatmen_inport1857_caleb_bingham1048x698.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Era_of_Good_Feelings	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/James_Monroe_02.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Jolly_flatboatmen_inport1857_caleb_bingham1048x698.jpg"]	f	cover
183	Adam Smith	Adam Smith (5 June 1723 OS (16 June 1723 NS) – 17 July 1790) was a Scottish moral philosopher and a pioneer of political economy. One of the key figures of the Scottish Enlightenment, Smith is best known for two classic works: The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759), and An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776). The latter, usually abbreviated as The Wealth of Nations, is considered his magnum opus and the first modern work of economics. Smith is cited as the "father of modern economics" and is still among the most influential thinkers in the field of economics today.\nSmith studied social philosophy at the University of Glasgow and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was one of the first students to benefit from scholarships set up by fellow Scot, John Snell. After graduating, he delivered a successful series of public lectures at the University of Edinburgh, leading him to collaborate with David Hume during the Scottish Enlightenment. Smith obtained a professorship at Glasgow teaching moral philosophy, and during this time he wrote and published The Theory of Moral Sentiments. In his later life, he took a tutoring position that allowed him to travel throughout Europe, where he met other intellectual leaders of his day. Smith laid the foundations of classical free market economic theory. The Wealth of Nations was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, he expounded upon how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirized by Tory writers in the moralizing tradition of William Hogarth and Jonathan Swift. In 2005, The Wealth of Nations was named among the 100 Best Scottish Books of all time. Former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, it is said, used to carry a copy of the book in her handbag.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Adam_Smith_statue.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Fran%C3%A7ois_Quesnay.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6e/Adam_smith_note.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Flickr_-_Jeff_Attaway_-_fish_pole.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/19/Smith_medallion_portrait.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Sanborn-CSU.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Adam_Smith%27s_mother.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/AdamSmithsignature.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Adam_Smith_Theatre%2C_Bennochy_Road%2C_Kirkcaldy.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Adam_Smith_Grave.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/19th-century_building_at_location_where_Adam_Smith_lived%2C_1767-1776.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Kirkcaldy_High_Street_Adam_Smith_Plaque.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/AdamSmith1790b.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/AdamSmith.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Wealth_of_Nations.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Allan_Ramsay_-_David_Hume%2C_1711_-_1776._Historian_and_philosopher_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Adam_Smith_statue.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg"]	f	contain

476	Baroque literature	The history of literature of the Early Modern period (16th, 17th and partly 18th century literature). Early Modern literature succeeds Medieval literature, and in Europe in particular Renaissance literature.\nIn Europe, the Early Modern period lasts roughly from 1550 to 1750, spanning the Baroque period and ending with the Age of Enlightenment and the wars of the French Revolution. The Early Modern period in Persia corresponds to the rule of the Safavid dynasty. In Japan, the "Early Modern period" (Edo period) is taken to last down to 1868 (the beginning of Industrialization during the Meiji period), in India, the Mughal era lasts until the establishment of the British Raj in 1857. The Ottoman Empire undergoes various attempts of modernization from 1828 (Tanzimat).\nChinese literature of the Qing dynasty remains mostly unaffected by European influence, and effects of modernization that would lead up to the New Culture Movement become visible only form the Late Qing period in the 1890s.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Modern_literature	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Books-aj.svg_aj_ashton_01.svg"]	f	cover
340	Abraham Lincoln	Abraham Lincoln /ˈeɪbrəhæm ˈlɪŋkən/ (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was the 16th President of the United States, serving from March 1861 until his assassination in April 1865. Lincoln led the United States through its Civil War—its bloodiest war and its greatest moral, constitutional and political crisis. In so doing he preserved the Union, abolished slavery, strengthened the federal government and modernized the economy.\nReared in a poor family on the western frontier, Lincoln was a self-educated lawyer in Illinois, a Whig Party leader, state legislator during the 1830s, and a one-term member of the Congress during the 1840s. He promoted rapid modernization of the economy through banks, canals, railroads and tariffs to encourage the building of factories; he opposed the war with Mexico in 1846. After a series of highly publicized debates in 1858 during which he opposed the expansion of slavery, Lincoln lost the U.S. Senate race to his archrival, Democrat Stephen A. Douglas. Lincoln, a moderate from a swing state, secured the Republican Party presidential nomination in 1860. With almost no support in the South, Lincoln swept the North and was elected president in 1860. His election prompted seven southern slave states to form the Confederacy. No compromise or reconciliation was found regarding slavery.\nWhen the North enthusiastically rallied behind the national flag after the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861, Lincoln concentrated on the military and political dimensions of the war effort. His goal was to reunite the nation. He suspended habeas corpus, arresting and temporarily detaining thousands of suspected secessionists in the border states without trial. Lincoln averted British intervention by defusing the Trent affair in late 1861. His numerous complex moves toward ending slavery centered on the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, using the Army to protect escaped slaves, encouraging the border states to outlaw slavery, and helping push through Congress the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which permanently outlawed slavery. Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, especially the selection of top generals, including commanding general Ulysses S. Grant. He made the major decisions on Union war strategy, Lincoln's Navy set up a naval blockade that shut down the South's normal trade, helped take control of Kentucky and Tennessee, and gained control of the Southern river system using gunboats. He tried repeatedly to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond. Each time a general failed, Lincoln substituted another until finally Grant succeeded in 1865.\nAn exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state, Lincoln reached out to "War Democrats" (who supported the North against the South), and managed his own re-election in the 1864 presidential election. As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican party, confronted Radical Republicans who demanded harsher treatment of the South, War Democrats who called for more compromise, Copperheads who despised him, and irreconcilable secessionists who plotted his death. Politically, Lincoln fought back with patronage, by pitting his opponents against each other, and by appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory. His Gettysburg Address of 1863 became an iconic statement of America's dedication to the principles of nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy. Lincoln held a moderate view of Reconstruction, seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness. Six days after the surrender of Confederate commanding general Robert E. Lee, Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth, a noted actor and Confederate sympathizer.\nLincoln has been consistently ranked both by scholars and the public as one of the greatest U.S. presidents.\n\n	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Abraham_Lincoln_November_1863.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Lincoln_Museum_Exterior.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/The_Assassination_of_President_Lincoln_-_Currier_and_Ives_2.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Speakerlink-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Abraham_Lincoln_head_on_shoulders_photo_portrait.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/80/Wikipedia-logo-v2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/People_icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/RunningtheMachine-LincAdmin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Seal_Of_The_President_Of_The_United_States_Of_America.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Major_Robert_Anderson.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Mary_Todd_Lincoln_1846-1847_restored_cropped.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Mathew_Brady%2C_Portrait_of_Secretary_of_the_Treasury_Salmon_P._Chase%2C_officer_of_the_United_States_government_%281860%E2%80%931865%2C_full_version%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Office-book.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Abraham_lincoln_inauguration_1861.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Abraham_Lincoln_giving_his_second_Inaugural_Address_%284_March_1865%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Aerial_view_of_Lincoln_Memorial_-_east_side_EDIT.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Acw_bs_7a.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/DredScott.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/DodgerBlue_flag_waving.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Emancipation_proclamation.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/ElectoralCollege1860.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Lincolns_Gettysburg_Address%2C_Gettysburg.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Lincoln_and_McClellan_1862-10-03.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Lincoln_and_Johnsond.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Young_Lincoln_By_Charles_Keck.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Wikipedia-logo-v2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Wikinews-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Union_soldiers_entrenched_along_the_west_bank_of_the_Rappahannock_River_at_Fredericksburg%2C_Virginia_%28111-B-157%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/The_Rail_Candidate.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/The_Peacemakers_1868.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Abraham_Lincoln_November_1863.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Abraham_Lincoln_1862_signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Abraham_Lincoln_O-55%2C_1861-crop.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Abraham_Lincoln_O-116_by_Gardner%2C_1865-crop.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/1864_Electoral_Map.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/AbrahamLincolnOilPainting1869Restored.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/A%26TLincoln.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Abraham_Lincoln_by_Nicholas_Shepherd%2C_1846-crop.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Abraham_Lincoln_by_Byers%2C_1858_-_crop.jpg"]	f	60%
393	Adolf Hitler	Adolf Hitler (German: [ˈadɔlf ˈhɪtlɐ] ( ); 20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) was an Austrian-born German politician and the leader of the Nazi Party (German: Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP); National Socialist German Workers Party). He was chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945 and dictator of Nazi Germany (as Führer und Reichskanzler) from 1934 to 1945. Hitler was at the centre of Nazi Germany, World War II in Europe, and the Holocaust.\nHitler was a decorated veteran of World War I. He joined the German Workers' Party (precursor of the NSDAP) in 1919, and became leader of the NSDAP in 1921. In 1923, he attempted a coup in Munich to seize power. The failed coup resulted in Hitler's imprisonment, during which time he wrote his memoir, Mein Kampf (My Struggle). After his release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles that had been forced on Germany and promoted nationalism, Pan-Germanism, and antisemitism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. Hitler frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as being part of a Jewish conspiracy.\nHitler's Nazi Party became the largest democratically elected party in the German Reichstag, leading to his appointment as chancellor in 1933. Following fresh elections won by his coalition, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act, which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into the Third Reich, a single-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of National Socialism. Hitler aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the denunciation of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I, and the annexation of territories that were home to millions of ethnic Germans, actions which gave him significant popular support.\nHitler actively sought Lebensraum ("living space") for the German people. His aggressive foreign policy is considered to be the primary cause of the outbreak of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale rearmament and on 1 September 1939 invaded Poland, resulting in British and French declarations of war on Germany. In June 1941, Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1941 German forces and their European allies occupied most of Europe and North Africa. Failure to defeat the Soviets and the entry of the United States into the war forced Germany onto the defensive and it suffered a series of escalating defeats, partly because of Hitler's countless strategic blunders. In the final days of the war, during the Battle of Berlin in 1945, Hitler married his long-time lover, Eva Braun. On 30 April 1945, less than two days later, the two committed suicide to avoid capture by the Red Army, and their corpses were burned. Under Hitler's leadership and racially motivated ideology, the regime was responsible for the genocide of at least 5.5 million Jews, and millions of other victims whom he and his followers deemed racially inferior.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Hitler_1914_1918.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg",

441	Cuban missile crisis	The Cuban missile crisis — known as the October Crisis or The Missile Scare (Spanish: Crisis de octubre) in Cuba and the Caribbean Crisis (Russian: Карибский кризис, tr. Karibskiy krizis) in the former USSR — was a 13-day confrontation in October 1962 between the Soviet Union and Cuba on one side and the United States on the other side. The crisis is generally regarded as the moment in which the Cold War came closest to turning into a nuclear conflict and is also the first documented instance of mutual assured destruction (MAD) being discussed as a determining factor in a major international arms agreement.\nAfter the US had placed nuclear missiles in Turkey and Italy, aimed at Moscow, and the failed US attempt to overthrow the Cuban regime, in May 1962 Nikita Khrushchev proposed the idea of placing Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba to deter any future invasion attempt. During a meeting between Khrushchev and Fidel Castro that July, a secret agreement was reached and construction of several missile sites began in the late summer.\nThese preparations were noticed by the Defense Intelligence Agency, which on October 14 tasked an Air Force-operated U-2 aircraft with scanning the suspected areas in Cuba, securing clear photographic evidence of medium-range and intermediate-range ballistic nuclear missiles (MRBMs and IRBMs) on the ground. The United States considered attacking Cuba via air and sea, but decided on a military blockade instead, calling it a "quarantine" for legal and other reasons. The US announced that it would not permit offensive weapons to be delivered to Cuba, while demanding the dismantlement and return of Soviet weapons back to the USSR.\nThe Kennedy administration held only a slim hope that the Kremlin would agree to their demands, and expected a military confrontation. These fears were underpinned by the October 24, 1962 letter of Soviet Premier Khrushchev to President John F. Kennedy, in which he stated that the US blockade of "navigation in international waters and air space" constituted "an act of aggression propelling human kind into the abyss of a world nuclear-missile war". However, in secret back-channel communications the President and Premier initiated a proposal to resolve the crisis.\nWhile the tense negotiations were taking place, several Soviet ships attempted to run the blockade, increasing tensions to the point that orders were sent out to US Navy ships to fire warning shots and then open fire. On October 27, a U-2 plane was shot down by a Soviet missile crew, an action that could have resulted in immediate retaliation from the Kennedy crisis cabinet, according to Secretary of Defense McNamara's later testimony. Kennedy stayed his hand and the negotiations continued.\nThe confrontation ended on October 28, 1962, when Kennedy and United Nations Secretary-General U Thant reached an agreement with Khrushchev. Publicly, the Soviets would dismantle their offensive weapons in Cuba and return them to the Soviet Union, subject to United Nations verification, in exchange for a US public declaration and agreement never to invade Cuba. Secretly, the US also agreed that it would dismantle all US-built Jupiter IRBMs, armed with nuclear warheads, which were deployed in Turkey and Italy against the Soviet Union.\nAfter the removal of the missiles and Ilyushin Il-28 light bombers from Cuba, the blockade was formally ended at 6:45 pm EST on November 20, 1962. The tense negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union pointed out the necessity of a quick, clear and direct communication between Washington and Moscow. As a result, the Moscow-Washington hotline was established.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/P-2H_Neptune_over_Soviet_ship_Oct_1962.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_missile_crisis	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Flag_of_NATO.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Soviet_b-59_submarine.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/U-2F_refueling_from_KC-135Q.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/U2_Image_of_Cuban_Missile_Crisis.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Warsaw_Pact_Logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Jupiter_IRBM.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Location_of_Navy_and_Soviet_ships_during_the_Cuban_Missile_Crisis.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Khrushchev_letter_to_kennedy.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Flag_of_NATO.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/McNamara_and_Kennedy.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/President_Kennedy_signs_Cuba_quarantine_proclamation%2C_23_October_1962.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/P-2H_Neptune_over_Soviet_ship_Oct_1962.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Soviet-R-12-nuclear-ballistic_missile.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/S-75_Dzwina_RB2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/John_F_Kennedy_Address_on_the_Buildup_of_Arms_in_Cuba.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/03/Flag_of_Italy.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/EXCOMM_meeting%2C_Cuban_Missile_Crisis%2C_29_October_1962.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Cold_War_Map_1959.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Flag_of_Cuba.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Engine_u2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Adlai_Stevenson_shows_missiles_to_UN_Security_Council_with_David_Parker_standing.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Coat_of_Arms_of_Cuba.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/CMC_Gromyko.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Flag_of_the_Soviet_Union.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Flag_of_Turkey.svg"]	f	cover
412	Aldous Huxley	Aldous Leonard Huxley /ˈhʌksli/ (26 July 1894 – 22 November 1963) was an English writer and a prominent member of the Huxley family. Best known for his novels including Brave New World, set in a dystopian London, The Doors of Perception, which recalls experiences when taking a psychedelic drug, and a wide-ranging output of essays. Huxley also edited the magazine Oxford Poetry, and published short stories, poetry, travel writing, film stories and scripts. He spent the later part of his life in the United States, living in Los Angeles from 1937 until his death.\nHuxley was a humanist, pacifist, and satirist. He became deeply concerned that human beings might become subjugated through the sophisticated use of the mass media or mood-altering drugs, or tragically impacted by misunderstanding or the misapplication of increasingly sophisticated technology.\nHuxley later became interested in spiritual subjects such as parapsychology and philosophical mysticism, in particular, Universalism. He is also well known for his use of psychedelic drugs. By the end of his life Huxley was widely acknowledged as one of the pre-eminent intellectuals of his time.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Aldous_Huxley_signature.svg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldous_Huxley	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Aldous_Huxley.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/SomeBloomsburymembers.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Aldous_Huxley_signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg"]	f	contain
440	Afghanistan	Afghanistan /æfˈɡænɨstæn/ (Persian/Pashto: افغانستان, Afġānistān), officially the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, is a landlocked country located in Central Asia, South Asia, and is a part of the Greater Middle East. It has a population of around 30 million inhabiting an area of approximately 652,000 km2 (252,000 sq mi), making it the 42nd most populous and 41st largest nation in the world. It is bordered by Pakistan in the south and the east, Iran in the west, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan in the north, and China in the far northeast.\nAfghanistan has been an ancient focal point of the Silk Road and human migration. Archaeologists have found evidence of human habitation from as far back as the Middle Paleolithic. Urban civilization may have begun in the area as early as 3,000 to 2,000 BC. Sitting at an important geostrategic location that connects the Middle East culture with Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent, the land has been home to various peoples through the ages and witnessed many military campaigns, notably by Alexander the Great, Arab Muslims, Genghis Khan, and in modern-era Western forces. The land also served as a source from which the Kushans, Hephthalites, Samanids, Ghaznavids, Ghorids, Mughals, Durranis and others have risen to form major empires.\nMost of Afghanistan's history prior to the modern state of Afghanistan took place within the context of the various Persian Empires. The political history of the modern state of Afghanistan begins in 1709 with the rise of the Pashtuns - historically known as "Afghans" - when the Hotaki dynasty was established in Kandahar followed by the rise of the Durrani Empire in 1747. In the late 19th century, Afghanistan became a buffer state in the "Great Game" between British India and the Russian Empire. Following the 1919 Anglo-Afghan War, King Amanullah began a European style modernization of the country but was stopped by ultra-conservatives. During the Cold War, after the withdrawal of the British from neighboring India in 1947, the United States and the Soviet Union began spreading influences in Afghanistan, which led in 1979 to a bloody war between the US-backed mujahideen forces and the Soviet-backed Afghan government in which over a million Afghans lost their lives. This was followed by a 1990s civil war, the rise and fall of the extremist Taliban government, and the 2001–present war. In December 2001, the United Nations Security Council authorized the creation of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to help maintain security in Afghanistan and assist the Karzai administration.\nThree decades of war made Afghanistan one of the world's most dangerous countries. While the international community is rebuilding war-torn Afghanistan, terrorist groups such as the Haqqani Network and Hezbi Islami are actively involved in a nationwide Taliban-led insurgency, which includes hundreds of assassinations and suicide attacks. According to the United Nations, the insurgents were responsible for 80% of civilian casualties in 2011 and 2012. It suffers from several challenges, including being world's most corrupt country and is the World's largest source of refugees.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Flag_of_Afghanistan.svg/500px-Flag_of_Afghanistan.svg.png	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Young_Pashai_man_with_flowers_in_his_hair.jpg",

182	David Hume	David Hume (/ˈhjuːm/; 7 May [O.S. 26 April] 1711 – 25 August 1776) was a Scottish philosopher, historian, economist, and essayist known especially for his philosophical empiricism and skepticism. He was one of the most important figures in the history of Western philosophy and the Scottish Enlightenment. Hume is often grouped with John Locke, George Berkeley, and a handful of others as a British Empiricist.\nBeginning with his A Treatise of Human Nature (1739), Hume strove to create a total naturalistic "science of man" that examined the psychological basis of human nature. In stark opposition to the rationalists who preceded him, most notably Descartes, he concluded that desire rather than reason governed human behaviour, saying: "Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions". A prominent figure in the sceptical philosophical tradition and a strong empiricist, he argued against the existence of innate ideas, concluding instead that humans have knowledge only of things they directly experience. Thus he divides perceptions between strong and lively "impressions" or direct sensations and fainter "ideas", which are copied from impressions. He developed the position that mental behaviour is governed by "custom", that is acquired ability; our use of induction, for example, is justified only by our idea of the "constant conjunction" of causes and effects. Without direct impressions of a metaphysical "self", he concluded that humans have no actual conception of the self, only of a bundle of sensations associated with the self.\nHume advocated a compatibilist theory of free will that proved extremely influential on subsequent moral philosophy. He was also a sentimentalist who held that ethics are based on feelings rather than abstract moral principles. Hume also examined the normative is–ought problem. He held notoriously ambiguous views of Christianity, but famously challenged the argument from design in his Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (1777).\nImmanuel Kant credited Hume with waking him up from his "dogmatic slumbers" and Hume has proved extremely influential on subsequent philosophy, especially on utilitarianism, logical positivism, William James, philosophy of science, early analytic philosophy, cognitive philosophy, and other movements and thinkers. The philosopher Jerry Fodor proclaimed Hume's Treatise "the founding document of cognitive science". Also famous as a prose stylist, Hume pioneered the essay as a literary genre and engaged with contemporary intellectual luminaries such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Adam Smith (who acknowledged Hume's influence on his economics and political philosophy), James Boswell, Joseph Butler, and Thomas Reid.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Allan_Ramsay_-_David_Hume%2C_1711_-_1776._Historian_and_philosopher_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/David_Hume_and_Adam_Smith_statues.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/David_Hume_1754.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Painting_of_David_Hume.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Humetomb.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Allan_Ramsay_-_David_Hume%2C_1711_-_1776._Historian_and_philosopher_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/David_Hume.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/DavidHume.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg"]	f	75%
462	Filippo Brunelleschi	Filippo Brunelleschi (Italian: [fiˈlippo brunelˈleski]; 1377 – April 15, 1446) was one of the foremost architects and engineers of the Italian Renaissance. He is perhaps most famous for his development of linear perspective and for engineering the dome of the Florence Cathedral, but his accomplishments also include other architectural works, sculpture, mathematics, engineering and even ship design. His principal surviving works are to be found in Florence, Italy.\nLittle is known about the early life of Brunelleschi, the only sources being Antonio Manetti and Giorgio Vasari. According to these sources, Filippo's father was Brunellesco di Lippo, a lawyer, and his mother was Giuliana Spini. Filippo was the middle of their three children. The young Filippo was given a literary and mathematical education intended to enable him to follow in the footsteps of his father, a civil servant. Being artistically inclined, however, Filippo enrolled in the Arte della Seta, the silk merchants' Guild, which also included goldsmiths, metalworkers, and bronze workers. He became a master goldsmith in 1398. It was thus not a coincidence that his first important building commission, the Ospedale degli Innocenti, came from the guild to which he belonged.\nIn 1401, Brunelleschi entered a competition to design a new set of bronze doors for the Florence Baptistery. Seven competitors each produced a gilded bronze panel, depicting the Sacrifice of Isaac. Brunelleschi's entry, which, with that of Lorenzo Ghiberti, is one of only two to have survived, made reference to the Greco-Roman Boy with Thorn, whilst Ghiberti used a naked torso in the Classical style for his figure of Isaac. In 1403, Ghiberti was announced the victor, largely because of his superior technical skill: his panel showed a more sophisticated knowledge of bronze-casting being cast as a single piece. Brunelleschi's panel, by contrast, consisted of several pieces bolted to the back plate. Ghiberti went on to complete a second set of bronze doors for the baptistery, whose beauty Michelangelo extolled a hundred years later, saying "surely these must be the "Gates of Paradise".	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Masaccio%2C_cappella_brancacci%2C_san_pietro_in_cattedra._ritratto_di_filippo_brunelleschi.jpg/544px-Masaccio%2C_cappella_brancacci%2C_san_pietro_in_cattedra._ritratto_di_filippo_brunelleschi.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filippo_Brunelleschi	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Masaccio%2C_cappella_brancacci%2C_san_pietro_in_cattedra._ritratto_di_filippo_brunelleschi.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Duomo_Firenze_Apr_2008_%2813%29.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Santo_Spirito%2C_inside_1.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Pazzi_Chapel_Santa_Croce_Apr_2008_P.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Brunelleschi%27s_perspective_experiment.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Bunelleschi.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Brunelleshi-and-Duomo-of-Florence.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/View_of_the_Duomo%27s_dome%2C_Florence.jpg"]	f	cover

16	Sandro Botticelli	Alessandro di Mariano di Vanni Filipepi, better known as Sandro Botticelli (Italian: [ˈsandro bottiˈtʃɛlli]; c. 1445 – May 17, 1510), was an Italian painter of the Early Renaissance. He belonged to the Florentine School under the patronage of Lorenzo de' Medici, a movement that Giorgio Vasari would characterize less than a hundred years later as a "golden age", a thought, suitably enough, he expressed at the head of his Vita of Botticelli. Botticelli's posthumous reputation suffered until the late 19th century; since then his work has been seen to represent the linear grace of Early Renaissance painting. Among his best known works are The Birth of Venus and Primavera.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Sandro_Botticelli_083.jpg/633px-Sandro_Botticelli_083.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandro_Botticelli	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/La_nascita_di_Venere_%28Botticelli%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Sandro_Botticelli_-_Inferno%2C_Canto_XVIII_-_WGA02854.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Padlock-silver-light.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Sandro_Botticelli_083.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Boticelli_-_Mystische_Geburt.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/C_o_a_popes_Della_Rovere.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Botticelli-primavera.jpg"]	f	contain
17	Lorenzo de' Medici	Lorenzo de' Medici (1 January 1449 – 9 April 1492) was an Italian statesman and de facto ruler of the Florentine Republic during the Italian Renaissance. Known as Lorenzo the Magnificent (Lorenzo il Magnifico) by contemporary Florentines, he was a diplomat, politician and patron of scholars, artists, and poets. He is perhaps best known for his contribution to the art world, giving large amounts of money to artists so they could create master works of art. His life coincided with the high point of the mature phase Italian Renaissance and his death coincided with the end of the Golden Age of Florence. The fragile peace he helped maintain between the various Italian states collapsed with his death.

19	Girolamo Savonarola	Girolamo Savonarola (Italian: [savonaˈroːla]; 1452–1498) was an Italian Dominican friar and preacher active in Renaissance Florence, and known for his prophecies of civic glory and calls for Christian renewal. He denounced clerical corruption, despotic rule and the exploitation of the poor. He prophesied the coming of a biblical flood and a new Cyrus from the north who would reform the Church. This seemed confirmed when Charles VIII of France invaded Italy and threatened Florence. While Savonarola intervened with the king, the Florentines expelled the ruling Medici and, at the friar’s urging, established a popular republic. Declaring that Florence would be the New Jerusalem, the world center of Christianity and "richer, more powerful, more glorious than ever", he instituted a puritanical campaign, enlisting the active help of Florentine youth.\nIn 1495 when Florence refused to join Pope Alexander VI’s Holy League against the French, Savonarola was summoned to Rome. He disobeyed and further defied the pope by preaching under a ban, highlighting his campaign for reform with processions, bonfires of the vanities, and pious theatricals. In retaliation, the Pope excommunicated him and threatened to place the city under an interdict. A trial by fire proposed by a rival Florentine preacher to test Savonarola’s divine mandate was a fiasco, and popular opinion turned against him. Savonarola and two lieutenants were imprisoned. Under torture, Savonarola confessed that he had invented his visions and prophecies. On May 23, 1498, the three friars were condemned, hanged, and burned in the main square of Florence. Savonarola’s devotees, the Piagnoni, kept his cause of republican freedom and religious reform alive well into the next century, although the Medici—restored to power with the help of the papacy—eventually broke the movement.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Girolamo_Savonarola.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girolamo_Savonarola	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/SavonarolaPlaque_crop_gobeirne.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Girolamo_Savonarola.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Hanging_and_burning_of_Girolamo_Savonarola_in_Florence.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Girolamo_Savonarola_Signature.svg"]	f	70%
22	Leonardo da Vinci	Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (Italian pronunciation: [leoˈnardo da vˈvintʃi]  pronunciation ; April 15, 1452 – May 2, 1519, Old Style) was an Italian Renaissance polymath: painter, sculptor, architect, musician, mathematician, engineer, inventor, anatomist, geologist, cartographer, botanist, and writer. His genius, perhaps more than that of any other figure, epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal. Leonardo has often been described as the archetype of the Renaissance Man, a man of "unquenchable curiosity" and "feverishly inventive imagination". He is widely considered to be one of the greatest painters of all time and perhaps the most diversely talented person ever to have lived. According to art historian Helen Gardner, the scope and depth of his interests were without precedent and "his mind and personality seem to us superhuman, the man himself mysterious and remote". Marco Rosci states that while there is much speculation about Leonardo, his vision of the world is essentially logical rather than mysterious, and that the empirical methods he employed were unusual for his time.\nBorn out of wedlock to a notary, Piero da Vinci, and a peasant woman, Caterina, in Vinci in the region of Florence, Leonardo was educated in the studio of the renowned Florentine painter, Verrocchio. Much of his earlier working life was spent in the service of Ludovico il Moro in Milan. He later worked in Rome, Bologna and Venice, and he spent his last years in France at the home awarded him by Francis I.\nLeonardo was, and is, renowned primarily as a painter. Among his works, the Mona Lisa is the most famous and most parodied portrait and The Last Supper the most reproduced religious painting of all time, with their fame approached only by Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam. Leonardo's drawing of the Vitruvian Man is also regarded as a cultural icon, being reproduced on items as varied as the euro coin, textbooks, and T-shirts. Perhaps fifteen of his paintings have survived, the small number because of his constant, and frequently disastrous, experimentation with new techniques, and his chronic procrastination. Nevertheless, these few works, together with his notebooks, which contain drawings, scientific diagrams, and his thoughts on the nature of painting, compose a contribution to later generations of artists rivalled only by that of his contemporary, Michelangelo.\nLeonardo is revered for his technological ingenuity. He conceptualised flying machines, a tank, concentrated solar power, an adding machine, and the double hull, also outlining a rudimentary theory of plate tectonics. Relatively few of his designs were constructed or were even feasible during his lifetime, but some of his smaller inventions, such as an automated bobbin winder and a machine for testing the tensile strength of wire, entered the world of manufacturing unheralded. He made important discoveries in anatomy, civil engineering, optics, and hydrodynamics, but he did not publish his findings and they had no direct influence on later science.\n\n	\N	\N	\N	http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_Hn78_KSOBk/UlQFaz-SkXI/AAAAAAAAARc/-M1kV9yGLUY/s1600/leonardo-da-vinci-08.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Da_Vinci_Studies_of_Embryos_Luc_Viatour.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Virgin_of_the_Rocks.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Studies_of_the_Arm_showing_the_Movements_made_by_the_Biceps.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Study_of_a_Tuscan_Landscape.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Study_of_horse.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Vinci_casa_Leonardo.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Leonardo_polyhedra.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Office-book.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Mona_Lisa%2C_by_Leonardo_da_Vinci%2C_from_C2RMF_retouched.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Isabella_d%27este.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Hugo_van_der_Goes_006.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Leonardo%2C_san_girolamo.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/It-Leonardo_di_ser_Piero_da_Vinci.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Leonardo_IMG_1759.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Leonardo_Da_Vinci_-_Annunciazione.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Leonardo_da_Vinci_-_Plan_of_Imola_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Leonardo_da_Vinci_-_Adorazione_dei_Magi_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Leonardo_da_vinci%2C_The_Virgin_and_Child_with_Saint_Anne_01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Leonardo_da_Vinci_-_Saint_John_the_Baptist_C2RMF_retouched.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Leonardo_da_Vinci_-_Virgin_and_Child_with_Ss_Anne_and_John_the_Baptist.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/%C3%9Altima_Cena_-_Da_Vinci_5.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Firma_de_Leonardo_Da_Vinci.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Design_for_a_Flying_Machine.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Francois_I_recoit_les_derniers_soupirs_de_Leonard_de_Vinci_by_Ingres.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Francesco_Melzi_-_Portrait_of_Leonardo_-_WGA14795.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/1_Workshop_of_Andrea_del_Verrocchio_%28Botticini%29_1460s_Metropolitan_Museum_N-Y.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Clos_luce_04_straight.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Andrea_del_Verrocchio_002.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Gylleneportarna.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Ghirlandaio_a-pucci-lorenzo-de-medici-f-sassetti_1.jpg"]	f	cover

6	Renaissance	The Renaissance (UK /rɨˈneɪsəns/, US /ˈrɛnɨsɑːns/, French pronunciation: ​[ʁənɛsɑ̃s], from French: Renaissance "re-birth", Italian: Rinascimento, from rinascere "to be reborn") was a cultural movement that spanned the period roughly from the 14th to the 17th century, beginning in Italy in the Late Middle Ages and later spreading to the rest of Europe. Though availability of paper and the invention of metal movable type sped the dissemination of ideas from the later 15th century, the changes of the Renaissance were not uniformly experienced across Europe.\nAs a cultural movement, it encompassed innovative flowering of Latin and vernacular literatures, beginning with the 14th-century resurgence of learning based on classical sources, which contemporaries credited to Petrarch, the development of linear perspective and other techniques of rendering a more natural reality in painting, and gradual but widespread educational reform.\nIn politics, the Renaissance contributed the development of the conventions of diplomacy, and in science an increased reliance on observation. Historians often argue this intellectual transformation was a bridge between the Middle Ages and Modern history. Although the Renaissance saw revolutions in many intellectual pursuits, as well as social and political upheaval, it is perhaps best known for its artistic developments and the contributions of such polymaths as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, who inspired the term "Renaissance man".\nThere is a consensus that the Renaissance began in Florence, Italy, in the 14th century. Various theories have been proposed to account for its origins and characteristics, focusing on a variety of factors including the social and civic peculiarities of Florence at the time; its political structure; the patronage of its dominant family, the Medici; and the migration of Greek scholars and texts to Italy following the Fall of Constantinople at the hands of the Ottoman Turks.\nThe Renaissance has a long and complex historiography, and in line with general scepticism of discrete periodizations, there has been much debate among historians reacting to the 19th-century glorification of the "Renaissance" and individual culture heroes as "Renaissance men", questioning the usefulness of Renaissance as a term and as a historical delineation. The art historian Erwin Panofsky observed of this resistance to the concept of Renaissance:\n\nIt is perhaps no accident that the factuality of the Italian Renaissance has been most vigorously questioned by those who are not obliged to take a professional interest in the aesthetic aspects of civilization—historians of economic and social developments, political and religious situations, and, most particularly, natural science—but only exceptionally by students of literature and hardly ever by historians of Art.\n\nSome have called into question whether the Renaissance was a cultural "advance" from the Middle Ages, instead seeing it as a period of pessimism and nostalgia for classical antiquity, while social and economic historians of the longue durée especially have instead focused on the continuity between the two eras, linked, as Panofsky himself observed, "by a thousand ties".\nThe word Renaissance, whose literal translation from French into English is "Rebirth", was first used and defined by French historian Jules Michelet in his 1855 work, Histoire de France. The word Renaissance has also been extended to other historical and cultural movements, such as the Carolingian Renaissance and the Renaissance of the 12th century.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Sanzio_01.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Ratusz2007.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Sanzio_01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Shakespeare.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Mona_Lisa%2C_by_Leonardo_da_Vinci%2C_from_C2RMF_retouched.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Italy_1494_v2.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Holbein-erasmus.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Karp_Zolotaryov_Theotokos_Late_17th_century.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Juleum.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Lorenzo_de%27_Medici-ritratto.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Leonardo_da_Vinci_-_presumed_self-portrait_-_WGA12798.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Plaguet03.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Palais_%C3%A0_facettes.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Thetriumphofdeath.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Salutati.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Hans_Holbein%2C_the_Younger_-_Sir_Thomas_More_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Firenze.PalVecchio05.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/David_von_Michelangelo.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Galilee.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Francois_Dubois_001.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/1543%2CAndreasVesalius%27Fabrica%2CBaseOfTheBrain.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Clovio_magi.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Alexander_VI_-_Pinturicchio_detail.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/GraoVasco1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/God2-Sistine_Chapel.png"]	f	cover
308	Karl Marx	Karl Heinrich Marx (German pronunciation: [kaːɐ̯l ˈhaɪnʀɪç ˈmaːɐ̯ks], 5 May 1818 – 14 March 1883) was a German philosopher, economist, sociologist, historian, journalist, and revolutionary socialist. Marx's work in economics laid the basis for the current understanding of labour and its relation to capital, and has influenced much of subsequent economic thought. He published numerous books during his lifetime, the most notable being The Communist Manifesto (1848) and Das Kapital (1867–1894).\nBorn into a wealthy middle-class family in Trier in the Prussian Rhineland, Marx studied at the University of Bonn and the University of Berlin, where he became interested in the philosophical ideas of the Young Hegelians. After his studies, he wrote for a radical newspaper in Cologne, and began to work out his theory of dialectical materialism. He moved to Paris in 1843, where he began writing for other radical newspapers and met Friedrich Engels, who would become his lifelong friend and collaborator. In 1849 he was exiled and moved to London together with his wife and children where he continued writing and formulating his theories about social and economic activity. He also campaigned for socialism and became a significant figure in the International Workingmen's Association.\nMarx's theories about society, economics and politics – collectively known as Marxism – hold that human societies progress through class struggle: a conflict between an ownership class that controls production and a dispossessed labouring class that provides the labour for production. He called capitalism the "dictatorship of the bourgeoisie," believing it to be run by the wealthy classes for their own benefit; and he predicted that, like previous socioeconomic systems, capitalism produced internal tensions which would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system: socialism. He argued that class antagonisms under capitalism between the bourgeoisie and proletariat would eventuate in the working class' conquest of political power in the form of a dictatorship of the proletariat and eventually establish a classless society, socialism or communism, a society governed by a free association of producers. Along with believing in the inevitability of socialism and communism, Marx actively fought for their implementation, arguing that social theorists and underprivileged people alike should carry out organised revolutionary action to topple capitalism and bring about socio-economic change.\nMarx has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history. Revolutionary socialist governments espousing Marxist concepts took power in a variety of countries in the 20th century, leading to the formation of such socialist states as the Soviet Union in 1922 and the People's Republic of China in 1949. Many labour unions and workers' parties worldwide are influenced by Marxism, while various theoretical variants, such as Leninism, Stalinism, Trotskyism, Maoism, and Dengism were developed from them. Marx is typically cited, with Émile Durkheim and Max Weber, as one of the three principal architects of modern social science.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Marx_old.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Socrates.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Symbol-hammer-and-sickle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/People_icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Red_flag_II.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Red_flag_waving.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Hegel.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6d/Marx_Moscow.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Karl_Marx_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Karl_Marx_001.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Ludwig_Andreas_Feuerbach.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Logo_sociology.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Marx%2BFamily_and_Engels.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/MandK_Industrial_Revolution_1900.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Marx_and_Engels.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Marx-Engels-Forum01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Marx_old.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Marx_birthplace_Trier.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Engels_1856.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Emblem-money.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Jenny-von-Westphalen.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Hammer_and_Sickle_Red_Star_with_Glow.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/100-Mark-1971.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Communist-manifesto.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Atheism_template.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/01/A_coloured_voting_box.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/KarlMarx_Tomb.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Jenny_laura_marx.jpg"]	f	contain
110	Counter-Reformation	The Counter-Reformation (also the Catholic Revival or Catholic Reformation) was the period of Catholic revival beginning with the Council of Trent (1545–1563) and ending at the close of the Thirty Years' War (1648), and was initiated in response to the Protestant Reformation. The Counter-Reformation was a comprehensive effort composed of four major elements:\nEcclesiastical or structural reconfiguration\nReligious orders\nSpiritual movements\nPolitical dimensions\nSuch reforms included the foundation of seminaries for the proper training of priests in the spiritual life and the theological traditions of the Church, the reform of religious life by returning orders to their spiritual foundations, and new spiritual movements focusing on the devotional life and a personal relationship with Christ, including the Spanish mystics and the French school of spirituality. It also involved political activities that included the Roman Inquisition.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Council_Trent.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Reformation	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/The_Battle_of_Lepanto_by_Paolo_Veronese.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/StJohnsAshfield_StainedGlass_GoodShepherd_Portrait_cropped.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Kruis_san_damiano.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Council_Trent.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Nicaea_icon.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Michelangelo%2C_Giudizio_Universale_02.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/046CupolaSPietro.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Vulgata.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Coat_of_arms_Holy_See.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Coat_of_arms_Holy_See.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Peter_Paul_Rubens_-_The_Adoration_of_the_Magi_-_WGA20244.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/P_christianity.svg"]	f	cover
40	Protestant Reformation	The Protestant Reformation was the schism within Western Christianity initiated by Martin Luther, John Calvin, and other early Protestants. Although there had been significant attempts at reform before Luther (notably those of John Wycliffe and Jan Huss), the date most usually given for the start of the Protestant Reformation is 1517, when Luther published The Ninety-Five Theses, and for its conclusion in 1648 with the Peace of Westphalia that ended the European wars of religion. Luther started by criticizing the relatively recent practice of selling indulgences, but the debate widened until it touched on many of the doctrines and devotional practices of the Catholic Church.\nIt led to the creation of new national Protestant churches. The largest of the new churches groupings were the Lutherans (mostly in Germany, the Baltics and Scandinavia) and the Reformed churches (mostly in Germany, France, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Scotland). It also influenced the Church of England decisively after 1547 under Edward VI and Elizabeth I although the national church had been made independent under Henry VIII in the early 1530s for political rather than religious reasons. There were many smaller bodies such as the Free Christians, as well.\nAlthough the core motivation behind these changes was theological, many other factors played a part, including the rise of nationalism, the Western Schism which eroded people's faith in the Papacy, the corruption of the Curia, and the new learning of the Renaissance which questioned much traditional thought. On a technological level the invention of the printing press proved extremely significant in that it provided the means for the rapid dissemination of new ideas.\nThe Roman Catholic Church responded with a Counter-Reformation initiated by the Council of Trent and spearheaded by the new order of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) specifically organized to counter the Protestant movement. In general, Northern Europe, with the exception of most of Ireland, turned Protestant. Southern Europe remained Roman Catholic, while Central Europe was a site of fierce conflict, escalating to full-scale war.\n\n	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Lutherbibel.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformation	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/P_christianity.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Cardinal_de_Richelieu.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Nuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Darnley_stage_3.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/StJohnsAshfield_StainedGlass_GoodShepherd_Portrait_cropped.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Kip-Trubar.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/John_Knox_preaching.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Lutherbibel.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Life_of_Martin_Luther.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/95Thesen.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Protestant_branches.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Francois_Dubois_001.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Calvin_1562.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Nicaea_icon.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Martin_Luther_by_Lucas_Cranach_der_%C3%84ltere.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Ulrich_Zwingli.jpg"]	f	80%
53	John Calvin	John Calvin (French: Jean Calvin French pronunciation: ​[ʒɑ̃ kalvɛ̃], born Jehan Cauvin: 10 July 1509 – 27 May 1564) was an influential French theologian and pastor during the Protestant Reformation. He was a principal figure in the development of the system of Christian theology later called Calvinism. Originally trained as a humanist lawyer, he broke from the Roman Catholic Church around 1530. After religious tensions provoked a violent uprising against Protestants in France, Calvin fled to Basel, Switzerland, where he published the first edition of his seminal work Institutes of the Christian Religion in 1536.\nIn that year, Calvin was recruited by William Farel to help reform the church in Geneva. The city council resisted the implementation of Calvin's and Farel's ideas, and both men were expelled. At the invitation of Martin Bucer, Calvin proceeded to Strasbourg, where he became the minister of a church of French refugees. He continued to support the reform movement in Geneva, and was eventually invited back to lead its church.\nFollowing his return, Calvin introduced new forms of church government and liturgy, despite the opposition of several powerful families in the city who tried to curb his authority. During this period, Michael Servetus, a Spaniard regarded by both Catholics and Protestants as having heretical views, arrived in Geneva. He was denounced by Calvin and executed by the city council. Following an influx of supportive refugees and new elections to the city council, Calvin's opponents were forced out. Calvin spent his final years promoting the Reformation both in Geneva and throughout Europe.\nCalvin was a tireless polemic and apologetic writer who generated much controversy. He also exchanged cordial and supportive letters with many reformers, including Philipp Melanchthon and Heinrich Bullinger. In addition to the Institutes, he wrote commentaries on most books of the Bible, as well as theological treatises and confessional documents. He regularly preached sermons throughout the week in Geneva. Calvin was influenced by the Augustinian tradition, which led him to expound the doctrine of predestination and the absolute sovereignty of God in salvation of the human soul from death and eternal damnation.\nCalvin's writing and preachings provided the seeds for the branch of theology that bears his name. The Reformed, Congregational, and Presbyterian churches, which look to Calvin as the chief expositor of their beliefs, have spread throughout the world.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Calvin_1562.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Calvin	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/William-Farel.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/John_Calvin_by_Holbein.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/John_Calvin_Titian_B.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Kalvin_Janos_ifj.Szlavics.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/John_Calvin_signature.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Michael_Servetus.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Martin-Bucer_1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Portrait_john_calvin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Nicaea_icon.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Tombe_Calvin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Strasbourg_-_%C3%89glise_Saint-Nicolas.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Fa%C3%A7ade_de_la_cath%C3%A9drale_Saint-Pierre_de_Gen%C3%A8ve.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Calvin_1562.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Joachim-Westphal.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Idelette_Calvin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Aile_Sud.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/CalvinInstitutio.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Calvin.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/John_Calvin_-_Young.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/John_Calvin%27s_handwriting_01.jpg"]	f	50%

463	Philip II of Spain	Philip II (Spanish: Felipe II; 21 May 1527 – 13 September 1598) was King of Spain from 1556 and of Portugal from 1581 (as Philip I, Filipe I). From 1554 he was King of Naples and Sicily as well as Duke of Milan. During his marriage to Queen Mary I (1554–58), he was also King of England and Ireland. From 1555, he was lord of the Seventeen Provinces of the Netherlands. Known in Spanish as "Philip the Prudent" (Felipe el Prudente), his empire included territories on every continent then known to Europeans, including his namesake Philippine Islands. During his reign, Spain reached the height of its influence and power. The expression "The empire on which the sun never sets" was coined during Philip's time to reflect the extent of his possessions.\nDuring Philip's reign there were separate state bankruptcies in 1557, 1560, 1575, and 1596. This was partly the cause for the declaration of independence which created the Dutch Republic in 1581. A devout Catholic, Philip is also known for organizing a huge naval expedition against Protestant England in 1588, known usually as the Spanish Armada, which was unsuccessful, partly due to storms and grave logistical problems.\nPhilip was described by the Venetian ambassador Paolo Fagolo in 1563 as "slight of stature and round-faced, with pale blue eyes, somewhat prominent lip, and pink skin, but his overall appearance is very attractive." The Ambassador went on to say "He dresses very tastefully, and everything that he does is courteous and gracious."	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Portrait_of_Philip_II_of_Spain_by_Sofonisba_Anguissola_-_002b.jpg/624px-Portrait_of_Philip_II_of_Spain_by_Sofonisba_Anguissola_-_002b.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_Spain	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0d/PhilipIIbust.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_Spain_%281580-1668%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/S%C3%A1nchez_Coello_Royal_feast.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Philip_II.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Philip_II_of_Spain_by_Antonio_Moro.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Portrait_of_King_Philip_II_of_Spain%2C_in_Gold-Embroidered_Costume_with_Order_of_the_Golden_Fleece.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Portrait_of_Philip_II_of_Spain_by_Sofonisba_Anguissola_-_002b.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Firma_del_Rey_Felipe_II.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Flag_of_the_Tercios_Morados_Viejos.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Full_Ornamented_Coat_of_Arms_of_Philip_II_of_Spain_%281580-1598%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Iberian_Union_Empires.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Coat_of_Arms_of_Spanish_Monarch.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Coat_of_Arms_of_Philip_II_of_Spain_as_Monarch_of_Naples_and_Sicily.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Coat_of_Arms_of_the_Kingdom_of_Portugal_%281640-1910%29.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Coat_of_Arms_of_the_King_of_Spain_as_Monarch_of_Milan_%281580-1700%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Coat_of_arms_Henri_I_of_Luxembourg_middle.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Coat_of_Arms_of_the_Prince_of_Asturias.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Estandarte_Real_de_Espa%C3%B1a.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Dominios_de_Felipe_II.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Felipe_of_Spain_and_MariaTudor.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Felipe_II_de_Espa%C3%B1a_01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Coat_of_Arms_of_England_%281554-1558%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Cenotafio_de_Felipe_II_y_su_familia.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Coat_of_Arms_of_Philip_II_of_Spain_%281558-1580%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Coat_of_Arms_of_Philip_II_of_Spain%2C_English_King_Consort-Spanish_Variant_%281556-1558%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Anthony_I_of_Portugal.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Bautizo_Felipe_II_grande.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Arms_of_Luxembourg.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Coat_of_Arms_of_Philip_II_of_Spain_as_Monarch_of_Milan_%281558-1580%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Coat_of_Arms_of_Philip_II_of_Spain_as_Monarch_of_Milan_%281554-1558%29.svg"]	f	contain
217	Thomas Gainsborough	Thomas Gainsborough FRSA (christened 14 May 1727 - 2 August 1788) was an English portrait and landscape painter. In 1769, he became a founding member of the Royal Academy, but his relationship with the organization was thorny and he sometimes withdrew his work from exhibition. Gainsborough moved to London in 1774, and painted portraits of the king and queen, but the king was obliged to name as royal painter Gainsborough's rival Joshua Reynolds. In his last years, Gainsborough painted relatively simple landscapes and is credited (with Richard Wilson) as the originator of the 18th century British landscape school. Gainsborough died of cancer in 1788 and was buried at St. Anne's Church, Kew. He painted quickly, and his later pictures are characterised by a light palette and easy strokes. He preferred landscapes to portraits. William Jackson in his contemporary essays said of him 'to his intimate friends he was sincere honest and his heart was always alive to every feeling of honour and generosity but avoided the company of literary men, who were his aversion, but for a letter to an intimate friend he had few equals and no superior'.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Thomas_Gainsborough_001.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Gainsborough	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Thomas_Gainsborough_Lady_Georgiana_Cavendish.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Thomas_Gainsborough_by_Thomas_Gainsborough.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Thomas_Gainsborough_019.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Thomas_Gainsborough_023.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Thomas_Gainsborough_024.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Thomas_Gainsborough_025.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Thomas_Gainsborough_008.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Thomas_Gainsborough_012.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Thomas_Gainsborough_014.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Thomas_Gainsborough_015.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Margaret_Burr_%281728-1797%29%2C_Mrs_Thomas_Gainsborough_by_Thomas_Gainsborough.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/Karl_Friedrich_Abel_by_Thomas_Gainsborough.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Thomas_Gainsboroguh_Georgiana_Duchess_of_Devonshire_1783.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Mr_and_Mrs_William_Hallett.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Thomas_Gainsborough_-_Mr_and_Mrs_Andrews.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Thomas_Gainsborough_-_Landscape_in_Suffolk_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Thomas_Gainsborough_-_The_Artist%27s_Daughters_with_a_Cat_-_WGA8404.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Thomas_Gainsborough_-_Portrait_of_a_Lady_in_Blue_-_WGA8414.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Thomas_Gainsborough_005.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Thomas_Gainsborough_001.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Wikinews-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Webmeia.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Gainsborough-HarvestWagon1784.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/GAINSBOROUGH_River_Landscape.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Girl_with_Pigs_by_Thomas_Gainsborough.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Gainsborough_-_The_Painters_Daughters_Chasing_a_Butterfly.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/10thViscountKilmorey.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Colonel_John_Bullock.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/4thDukeOfArgyll.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Johann_Christian_Bach_by_Thomas_Gainsborough.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Jean_Joseph_Merlin_%281735-1803%29_Painting_by_Thomas_Gainsborough.jpg"]	f	cover
28	Raphael	Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino (April 6 or March 28, 1483 – April 6, 1520), better known simply as Raphael, was an Italian painter and architect of the High Renaissance. His work is admired for its clarity of form and ease of composition and for its visual achievement of the Neoplatonic ideal of human grandeur. Together with Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, he forms the traditional trinity of great masters of that period.\nRaphael was enormously productive, running an unusually large workshop and, despite his death at 37, leaving a large body of work. Many of his works are found in the Vatican Palace, where the frescoed Raphael Rooms were the central, and the largest, work of his career. The best known work is The School of Athens in the Vatican Stanza della Segnatura. After his early years in Rome much of his work was executed by his workshop from his drawings, with considerable loss of quality. He was extremely influential in his lifetime, though outside Rome his work was mostly known from his collaborative printmaking. After his death, the influence of his great rival Michelangelo was more widespread until the 18th and 19th centuries, when Raphael's more serene and harmonious qualities were again regarded as the highest models. His career falls naturally into three phases and three styles, first described by Giorgio Vasari: his early years in Umbria, then a period of about four years (1504–1508) absorbing the artistic traditions of Florence, followed by his last hectic and triumphant twelve years in Rome, working for two Popes and their close associates.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Raffael_Stanza_della_Segnatura.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/03/Flag_of_Italy.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/WPVA-khamsa.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Baldassare_Castiglione%2C_by_Raffaello_Sanzio%2C_from_C2RMF_retouched.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Urteil_des_Paris.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Raphael%27s_Triumph_of_Galatea_01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Raphael%27s_grave%2C_Pantheon_2010.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Raffaello_-_ElisabettaGonzaga.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Raffaello_Sposalizio.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Raimondi3.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Raimondi_Lucretia%27s_suicide.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Raffael_stcatherina.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Raffaello%2C_pala_baglioni%2C_deposizione.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Raffaello%2C_studi_per_madonne_col_bambino.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Raffaello%2C_studio_per_le_tre_grazie_della_farnesina.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d4/PhrygianSibylRaphael.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Massatbolsena.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/PalaOddiRaffaello.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/PalaAnsidei.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Pantheon-raphaels-tomb.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/PalazzoBranconioDellAquila.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/RAFAEL_-_Madonna_Sixtina_%28Gem%C3%A4ldegalerie_Alter_Meister%2C_Dresde%2C_1513-14._%C3%93leo_sobre_lienzo%2C_265_x_196_cm%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Pope_Julius_II.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Raffael_Stanza_della_Segnatura.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Raffael_072.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Transfiguration_Raphael.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Sanzio_01_Raphael.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Sanzio_00.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Rapha%C3%ABl_-_%C3%89tude_Madone_d%27Albe_1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Raphael_missing.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Raphael_colonna_01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Raphael_Spasimo.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Raphael_-_The_Miraculous_Draft_of_Fishes_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Raphael_-_Madonna_in_the_Meadow_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Raphael_-_Bindo_Altoviti_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Fornarina.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Estudosguardasressurreicao-rafael-ashmuseum1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Giovanni_Santi_-_Christ_supported_by_two_angels.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Galatea_%28engraving%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/ChigiLorenzetto.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Deliveranceofstpeter.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/CrocefissioneRaffaello.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Lvr-george.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Giulio_Romano_001.jpg"]	f	cover
32	Chanson	A chanson (French pronunciation: ​[ʃɑ̃sɔ̃], "song", from Latin cantio) is in general any lyric-driven French song, usually polyphonic and secular. A singer specializing in chansons is known as a "chanteur" (male) or "chanteuse" (female); a collection of chansons, especially from the late Middle Ages and Renaissance, is also known as a chansonnier.	\N	\N	\N	http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/hypebeast-wordpress/image/2009/08/diesel-black-gold-insolent-chanson-silk-scarf.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanson	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Kynseker_Sopran.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Radio_Libertaire_10_ans_L%C3%A9o_Ferr%C3%A9_3.jpg"]	f	cover
41	John Wycliffe	John Wycliffe (/ˈwɪklɪf/; also spelled Wyclif, Wycliff, Wiclef, Wicliffe, Wickliffe; c. 1320 – December 1384) was an English Scholastic philosopher, theologian, lay preacher, translator, reformer and university teacher at Oxford in England, who was known as an early dissident in the Roman Catholic Church during the 14th century. His followers were known as Lollards, a somewhat rebellious movement, which preached anticlerical and biblically-centred reforms. The Lollard movement was a precursor to the Protestant Reformation (for this reason, Wycliffe is sometimes called "The Morning Star of the Reformation"). He was one of the earliest opponents of papal authority influencing secular power.\nWycliffe was also an early advocate for translation of the Bible into the common language. He completed his translation directly from the Vulgate into vernacular English in the year 1382, now known as Wycliffe's Bible. It is probable that he personally translated the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John; and it is possible he translated the entire New Testament, while his associates translated the Old Testament. Wycliffe's Bible appears to have been completed by 1384, with additional updated versions being done by Wycliffe's assistant John Purvey and others in 1388 and 1395.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Wycliffecollege_toronto_chapel1.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wycliffe	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Wycliffecollege_toronto_chapel1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/72/Brief_1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Jwycliffejmk.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/John_wycliffe_scriptro_majoris_britanniae_1548.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Nicaea_icon.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/John_Wycliffe_at_work.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Gloriole_blur.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Wycliffe_bones_Foxe.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg"]	f	cover
465	Catholic Church	The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.16 billion members worldwide. It is among the oldest religious institutions in the world and has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. The Catholic hierarchy is headed by the Pope, the Bishop of Rome. The Church teaches that it is the one true Church founded by Jesus Christ, that its bishops are the successors of Christ's apostles and that the Pope is the sole successor to Saint Peter who has apostolic primacy.\nThe Church maintains that the doctrine on faith and morals that it presents as definitive is infallible. There are a variety of doctrinal and theological emphases within the Catholic Church, including the Eastern Catholic Churches and religious communities such as the Jesuits, the Franciscans and the Dominicans.\nThe Catholic Church is Trinitarian and defines its mission as spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ, administering the sacraments and exercising charity. Catholic worship is highly liturgical, focusing on the Mass or Divine Liturgy during which the sacrament of the Eucharist is celebrated. The Church teaches that bread and wine used during the Mass become the body and blood of Christ through transubstantiation. The Catholic Church practises closed communion and only baptised members of the Church in a state of grace are ordinarily permitted to receive the Eucharist.\nCatholic social teaching emphasises support for the sick, the poor and the afflicted through the corporal works of mercy. The Catholic Church is the largest non-government provider of education and medical services in the world. Catholic spiritual teaching emphasises spread of the Gospel message and growth in spiritual discipline through the spiritual works of mercy.\nThe Church holds the Blessed Virgin Mary, as mother of Jesus Christ, in special regard and has defined four specific Marian dogmatic teachings, namely her Immaculate Conception without original sin, her status as the Mother of God, her perpetual virginity and her bodily Assumption into Heaven at the end of her earthly life. Numerous Marian devotions are also practised.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Pope_Francis_in_March_2013.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/President_and_Mrs._Reagan_meet_Pope_John_Paul_II_1982.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/P_christianity.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Palm-sunday-latin-mass.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/PatriarchsCross.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/Perugino_-_Entrega_de_las_llaves_a_San_Pedro_%28Capilla_Sixtina%2C_1481-82%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/LaPurisimaInmaculadaConcepciondeRibera.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Martin_Luther_by_Lucas_Cranach_der_%C3%84ltere.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Missale_Romanum.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/MotherTeresa_090.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Coat_of_arms_of_the_Vatican_City.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Coat_of_arms_Holy_See.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/Emblem_of_the_Papacy_SE.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Convento_de_San_Francisco_-_Ciudad_de_M%C3%A9xico_-_Creyente.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Flag_of_the_Vatican_City.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Extreme_Unction_Rogier_Van_der_Weyden.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Iglesia_cat%C3%B3lica_en_el_mundo.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Fra_Angelico_024.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Kruis_san_damiano.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Kanjirappally_Bishop_Mar_Mathew_Arackal_at_Tomb_of_Mar_Varghese_Payyappilly_Palakkappilly.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Thebible33.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/S%C3%A3o_Miguel_das_Miss%C3%B5es_%28Brazil%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/StPetersBasilicaEarlyMorning.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/StJohnsAshfield_StainedGlass_GoodShepherd_Portrait_cropped.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/St._Mary%27s_Catholic_Church_altar%2C_Alexandria%2C_VA.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Sound-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/BentoXVI-51-11052007_%28frag%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Battesimi0113.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Catholic_Church_Spoken_Version.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/C_o_a_popes_Della_Rovere.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/046CupolaSPietro.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Basilica_di_San_Pietro_1450.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Albrecht_Altdorfer_016.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Coat_of_arms_Holy_See.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Christian_cross.svg"]	f	cover
58	Henry VIII of England	Henry VIII (28 June 1491 – 28 January 1547) was King of England from 21 April 1509 until his death. He was Lord, and later assumed the Kingship, of Ireland, and continued the nominal claim by the English monarchs to the Kingdom of France. Henry was the second monarch of the Tudor dynasty, succeeding his father, Henry VII.\nBesides his six marriages, Henry VIII is known for his role in the separation of the Church of England from the Roman Catholic Church. Henry's struggles with Rome led to the separation of the Church of England from papal authority, the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and his own establishment as the Supreme Head of the Church of England. Yet he remained a believer in core Catholic theological teachings, even after his excommunication from the Roman Catholic Church. Henry oversaw the legal union of England and Wales with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542.\nIn 1513, the new king allied with the Holy Roman Emperor, Maximillian I, and invaded France with a large, well-equipped army, but achieved little at a considerable financial cost. Maximillian, for his part, used the English invasion to his own ends, and this prejudiced England's ability to defeat the French. This foray would prove the start of an obsession for Henry, who invaded again in 1544. This time, Henry's forces captured the important city of Boulogne, but again the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, supported Henry only as long as he needed to and England, strained by the enormous cost of the war, ransomed the city back for peace.\nHis contemporaries considered Henry in his prime to be an attractive, educated and accomplished king, and he has been described as "one of the most charismatic rulers to sit on the English throne". Besides ruling with considerable power, he also engaged himself as an author and composer. His desire to provide England with a male heir – which stemmed partly from personal vanity and partly because he believed a daughter would be unable to consolidate the Tudor dynasty and the fragile peace that existed following the Wars of the Roses – led to the two things for which Henry is most remembered: his six marriages and the English Reformation.

43	Jan Hus	Jan Hus (Czech pronunciation: [ˈjan ˈɦus] ( ); c. 1369 – 6 July 1415), often referred to in English as John Hus or John Huss, was a Czech priest, philosopher, reformer, and master at Charles University in Prague. After John Wycliffe, the theorist of ecclesiastical Reformation, Hus is considered the first Church reformer, as he lived before Luther, Calvin, and Zwingli.\nHe was burned at the stake for heresy against the doctrines of the Catholic Church, including those on ecclesiology, the Eucharist, and other theological topics. Hus was a key predecessor to the Protestant movement of the sixteenth century, and his teachings had a strong influence on the states of Europe, most immediately in the approval of a reformist Bohemian religious denomination, and, more than a century later, on Martin Luther himself.\nAfter his death in 1415, the followers of Hus's religious teachings (known as Hussites) rebelled against their Roman Catholic rulers and defeated five consecutive papal crusades between 1420 and 1431 in what became known as the Hussite Wars. A century later, as many as 90% of inhabitants of the Czech lands were non-Catholic and followed the teachings of Hus and his successors.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Jan_Hus_2.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Hus	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Konstanz_Paradies_Karte_1847.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/ff/Jan_Hus_Preaching_at_the_Bethlehem_Chapel.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Jan_Zizka_Vitkov_Prague_CZ_007.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Flag_of_the_Czech_Republic.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Cs-Jan_Hus.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Jan_Hus-Council_of_Constance.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Gloriole_blur.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Betlemska_kaple.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Prague_hus_statue.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Burning_of_jan_hus_at_the_stake_at_council_of_constance.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Betl%C3%A9msk%C3%A1_kaple_interior.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Jan_Hus_at_the_Stake.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Jan_Hus_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Spiezer_Chronik_Jan_Hus_1485.jpg"]	f	60%
45	Johann Eck	Dr. Johann Maier von Eck (13 November 1486 - 13 February 1543) was a German Scholastic theologian and defender of Catholicism during the Protestant Reformation. As early as the spring of 1517 Eck had entered into friendly relations with Martin Luther, who had regarded him as in harmony with his own views, but this illusion was short-lived. In his Obelisci Eck attacked Luther's theses, which had been sent to him by Christoph von Scheurl, and accused him of promoting the "heresy of the Bohemian Brethren", fostering anarchy within the Church and branded him a Hussite. Luther replied in his Asterisci adversxes obeliseos Eccii, while Andreas Karlstadt defended Luther's views of indulgences and engaged in a violent controversy with Eck.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Johannes-Eck.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Eck	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/62/PD-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Kruis_san_damiano.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Johannes-Eck.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Thomas_Aquinas_in_Stained_Glass.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/046CupolaSPietro.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Coat_of_arms_Holy_See.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Coat_of_arms_Holy_See.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg"]	f	contain
49	Inquisition	The Inquisition was a group of institutions within the judicial system of the Roman Catholic Church whose aim was to combat heresy. It started in 12th-century France to combat the spread of religious sectarianism, in particular the Cathars and the Waldensians. This Medieval Inquisition persisted into the 14th century, and from the 1250s was associated with the Dominican Order. In the early 14th century, two other movements attracted the attention of the Inquisition, the Knights Templar and the Beguines.\nAt the end of the Middle Ages, the concept and scope of the Inquisition was significantly expanded in response to the Protestant Reformation and the Catholic Counter-Reformation. Its geographic scope was expanded to other European countries, resulting in the Spanish Inquisition and Portuguese Inquisition. Those two countries in particular operated the Inquisition throughout their respective empires (Spanish and Portuguese) in the Americas, Asia, and Africa. Its focus now came to include the persecution of sorcery, an aspect almost entirely absent from the Medieval Inquisition, making it one of the agents in the Early Modern witch-hunts. Persecution of Jewish and Muslim converts to Catholicism was the special concern of the Spanish and Portuguese inquisitions because of the belief that they secretly practiced their old faiths, resulting in cruel methods of torture to extract confessions.\nThe institution of the Inquisition persisted after the end of the witch-trial period in the 18th century, but in the Age of Reason was abolished outside of the Papal States after the Napoleonic wars of the early 19th century. The institution survives as part of the Roman Curia, renamed to Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office in 1904.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Pedro_Berruguete_Saint_Dominic_Presiding_over_an_Auto-da-fe_1495.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Nicaea_icon.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Translation_to_english_arrow.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Pedro_Berruguete_Saint_Dominic_Presiding_over_an_Auto-da-fe_1495.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/1685_-_Inquisi%C3%A7%C3%A3o_Portugal.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Galileo_before_the_Holy_Office.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Escudo_inquisicion.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg"]	f	cover
345	Louis Pasteur	Louis Pasteur (/ˈluːi pæˈstɜr/, French: [lwi pastœʁ]; December 27, 1822 – September 28, 1895) was a French chemist and microbiologist renowned for his discoveries of the principles of vaccination, microbial fermentation and pasteurization. He is remembered for his remarkable breakthroughs in the causes and preventions of diseases, and his discoveries have saved countless lives ever since. He reduced mortality from puerperal fever, and created the first vaccines for rabies and anthrax. His medical discoveries provided direct support for the germ theory of disease and its application in clinical medicine. He is best known to the general public for his invention of the technique of treating milk and wine to stop bacterial contamination, a process now called pasteurization. He is regarded as one of the three main founders of bacteriology, together with Ferdinand Cohn and Robert Koch, and is popularly known as the "father of microbiology".\nPasteur also made significant discoveries in chemistry, most notably on the molecular basis for the asymmetry of certain crystals and racemization. He was the Director of the Pasteur Institute, established in 1887, till his death, and his body lies beneath the institute in a vault covered in depictions of his accomplishments in Byzantine mosaics.	\N	\N	\N	http://www.notablebiographies.com/images/uewb_08_img0544.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Pasteur	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Louis_Pasteur%2C_foto_av_F%C3%A9lix_Nadar_Crisco_edit.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Louis_Pasteur_experiment.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Louis_Pasteur_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Pcrystals.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Coldecygne.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Louis_Pasteur_Geburtshaus_in_Dole.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/LouisPasteurMonumentLille.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Vulitsya_Pastera.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Tableau_Louis_Pasteur.jpg"]	f	70%
466	Mary I of England	Mary I (18 February 1516 – 17 November 1558) was Queen of England and Ireland from July 1553 until her death. Her executions of Protestants caused her opponents to give her the sobriquet "Bloody Mary".\nShe was the only child of Henry VIII and his first wife Catherine of Aragon who survived to adulthood. Her younger half-brother, Edward VI, succeeded Henry in 1547. When Edward became mortally ill in 1553, he attempted to remove Mary from the line of succession because of religious differences. On his death their first cousin once removed, Lady Jane Grey, was initially proclaimed queen. Mary assembled a force in East Anglia and successfully deposed Jane, who was ultimately beheaded. In 1554, Mary married Philip of Spain, becoming queen consort of Habsburg Spain on his accession in 1556.\nAs the fourth crowned monarch of the Tudor dynasty, Mary is remembered for her restoration of Roman Catholicism after the short-lived Protestant reign of her half-brother. During her five-year reign, she had over 280 religious dissenters burned at the stake in the Marian persecutions. Her re-establishment of Roman Catholicism was reversed after her death in 1558 by her younger half-sister and successor, Elizabeth I.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Mary_Tudor_by_Horenbout.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_I_of_England	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Philip_II.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Padlock-silver-light.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Maria_Tudor1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Mary1_by_Eworth_3.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Mary1_by_Eworth_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Mary_I_by_Master_John.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Mary_I_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Armas_atribuidas_a_Letizia_Ortiz_como_Princesa_de_Asturias.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Felipe_of_Spain_and_MariaTudor.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Coat_of_Arms_of_England_%281554-1558%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Mary_Tudor_by_Horenbout.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Mary_I_of_England_by_Jacopo_da_Trezzo_1554.jpg"]	f	cover
62	Michel de Montaigne	Michel Eyquem de Montaigne (French: [miʃɛl ekɛm də mɔ̃tɛɲ]; 28 February 1533 – 13 September 1592) was one of the most influential writers of the French Renaissance, known for popularizing the essay as a literary genre. He became famous for his effortless ability to merge serious intellectual exercises with casual anecdotes and autobiography—and his massive volume Essais (translated literally as "Attempts" or "Trials") contains, to this day, some of the most widely influential essays ever written. Montaigne had a direct influence on writers all over the world, including René Descartes, Blaise Pascal, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Albert Hirschman, William Hazlitt, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Friedrich Nietzsche, Stefan Zweig, Eric Hoffer, Isaac Asimov, and possibly on the later works of William Shakespeare.\nIn his own time, Montaigne was admired more as a statesman than as an author. The tendency in his essays to digress into anecdotes and personal ruminations was seen as detrimental to proper style rather than as an innovation, and his declaration that, 'I am myself the matter of my book', was viewed by his contemporaries as self-indulgent. In time, however, Montaigne would be recognized as embodying, perhaps better than any other author of his time, the spirit of freely entertaining doubt which began to emerge at that time. He is most famously known for his remark, 'Que sçay-je?' ('What do I know?' in Middle French; modern French Que sais-je?). Remarkably modern even to readers today, Montaigne's attempt to examine the world through the lens of the only thing he can depend on implicitly—his own judgment—makes him more accessible to modern readers than any other author of the Renaissance. Much of modern literary non-fiction has found inspiration in Montaigne and writers of all kinds continue to read him for his masterful balance of intellectual knowledge and personal story-telling.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Michel_de_Montaigne.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_de_Montaigne	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Michel_de_Montaigne_Italienreise.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Michel_de_Montaigne_1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/St_Michel_de_Montaigne_Tour03.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/St_Michel_de_Montaigne_Ch%C3%A2teau01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/ArmoiriesMichelDeMontaigne.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Michel_de_Montaigne.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Michel-eyquem-de-montaigne_1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Unterschrift_des_Michel_de_Montaigne.png"]	f	80%

467	Northern Renaissance	The Northern Renaissance was the Renaissance that occurred in the European countries north of the Alps. Before 1497 Italian Renaissance humanism had little influence outside Italy. From the late 15th century the ideas spread around Europe. This influenced the German Renaissance, French Renaissance, English Renaissance, Renaissance in the Low Countries, Polish Renaissance and other national and localized movements, each with different characteristics and strengths.\nIn France, King Francis I imported Italian art, commissioned Venice artists (including Leonardo da Vinci), and built grand palaces at great expense, starting the French Renaissance. Trade and commerce in cities like Bruges in the 15th century and Antwerp in the 16th increased cultural exchange between Italy and the Low Countries, however in art, and especially architecture, late Gothic influences remained present until the arrival of Baroque even as painters increasingly drew on Italian models.\nUniversities and the printed book helped spread the spirit of the age through France, the Low Countries and the Holy Roman Empire, and then to Scandinavia and finally Britain by the late 16th century. Writers and humanists such as Rabelais, Pierre de Ronsard and Desiderius Erasmus were greatly influenced by the Italian Renaissance model and were part of the same intellectual movement. During the English Renaissance (which overlapped with the Elizabethan era) writers such as William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe composed works of lasting influence. The Renaissance was brought to Poland directly from Italy by artists from Florence and the Low Countries, starting the Polish Renaissance.\nIn some areas the Northern Renaissance was distinct from the Italian Renaissance in its centralization of political power. While Italy and Germany were dominated by independent city-states, most of Europe began emerging as nation-states or even unions of countries. The Northern Renaissance was also closely linked to the Protestant Reformation and the long series of internal and external conflicts between various Protestant groups and the Roman Catholic Church had lasting effects, such as the division of Europe	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Eyck.hubert.lamb.750pix.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Renaissance	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Sanzio_01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Eyck.hubert.lamb.750pix.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Gutenberg.press.jpg"]	f	cover

352	Theory of relativity	The theory of relativity, or simply relativity in physics, usually encompasses two theories by Albert Einstein: special relativity and general relativity. (The word relativity can also be used in the context of an older theory, that of Galilean invariance.)\nConcepts introduced by the theories of relativity include:\nMeasurements of various quantities are relative to the velocities of observers. In particular, space and time can dilate.\nSpacetime: space and time should be considered together and in relation to each other.\nThe speed of light is nonetheless invariant, the same for all observers.\nThe term "theory of relativity" was based on the expression "relative theory" (German: Relativtheorie) used by Max Planck in 1906, who emphasized how the theory uses the principle of relativity. In the discussion section of the same paper Alfred Bucherer used for the first time the expression "theory of relativity" (German: Relativitätstheorie).	\N	\N	\N	http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-B8qUR7WB-h0/T5WwZuq9OkI/AAAAAAAAAK4/IYWu2TMPP2E/s1600/gpb_geodetic.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Stylised_Lithium_Atom.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Spacetime_curvature.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Albert_Einstein_1979_USSR_Stamp.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Michelson-Morley_experiment_%28en%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Kennedy-Thorndike_experiment_DE.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Wooden_hourglass_3.jpg"]	f	cover
87	Edict of Nantes	The Edict of Nantes, issued on 13 April 1598, by Henry IV of France, granted the Calvinist Protestants of France (also known as Huguenots) substantial rights in a nation still considered essentially Catholic. In the Edict, Henry aimed primarily to promote civil unity. The Edict separated civil from religious unity, treated some Protestants for the first time as more than mere schismatics and heretics, and opened a path for secularism and tolerance. In offering general freedom of conscience to individuals, the Edict offered many specific concessions to the Protestants, such as amnesty and the reinstatement of their civil rights, including the right to work in any field or for the State and to bring grievances directly to the king. It marked the end of the religious wars that had afflicted France during the second half of the 16th century.\nThe Edict of St. Germain promulgated 36 years before by Catherine de Médici had granted limited tolerance to Huguenots, but was overtaken by events, as it was not formally registered until after the Massacre of Vassy on 1 March 1562, which triggered the first of the French Wars of Religion.\nThe later revocation of the Edict of Nantes in October 1685 by Louis XIV, the grandson of Henry IV, drove an exodus of Protestants, and increased the hostility of Protestant nations bordering France.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Edit_de_Nantes_Avril_1598.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Nantes	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Edit_de_Nantes_Avril_1598.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Louis_XIV_of_France.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/Henry_IV_of_france_by_pourbous_younger.jpg"]	f	cover
468	English Renaissance	The English Renaissance was a cultural and artistic movement in England dating from the late 15th and early 16th centuries to the early 17th century. It is associated with the pan-European Renaissance that is usually regarded as beginning in Italy in the late 14th century. Like most of northern Europe, England saw little of these developments until more than a century later. The beginning of the English Renaissance is often taken, as a convenience, to be 1485, when the Battle of Bosworth Field ended the Wars of the Roses and inaugurated the Tudor Dynasty. Renaissance style and ideas, however, were slow in penetrating England, and the Elizabethan era in the second half of the 16th century is usually regarded as the height of the English Renaissance.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Renaissance	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Sanzio_01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/be/Flag_of_England.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Queen_Elizabeth_I_%28%27The_Ditchley_portrait%27%29_by_Marcus_Gheeraerts_the_Younger.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Nicholas_Hilliard_013.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Coat_of_Arms_of_England_%281558-1603%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Shakespeare.jpg"]	f	cover
469	Church of England	The Church of England is the officially established Christian church in England and the mother church of the worldwide Anglican Communion. The church considers itself within the tradition of Western Christianity and dates its formal establishment principally to the mission to England by Saint Augustine of Canterbury in AD 597.\nAs a result of Augustine's mission, the church in England came under the authority of the pope. Initially prompted by a dispute over the annulment of the marriage of King Henry VIII to Catherine of Aragon, the Church of England separated from the Roman Catholic Church in 1534 and became the established church by an Act of Parliament in the Act of Supremacy, beginning a series of events known as the English Reformation. During the reign of Queen Mary I and King Philip, the church was fully restored under Rome in 1555. The pope's authority was again explicitly rejected after the accession of Queen Elizabeth I when the Act of Supremacy of 1558 was passed. Catholic and Reformed factions vied for determining the doctrines and worship of the church. This ended with the 1558 Elizabethan Settlement, which developed the understanding that the church was to be both Catholic and Reformed:\nCatholic in that it views itself as a part of the universal church of Jesus Christ in unbroken continuity with the early apostolic church. This is expressed in its emphasis on the teachings of the early Church Fathers, as formalised in the Apostles', Nicene, and Athanasian creeds.\nReformed in that it has been shaped by some of the doctrinal principles of the 16th century Protestant Reformation, in particular in the Thirty-Nine Articles and the Book of Common Prayer.\nSince the Reformation, the Church of England has used an English liturgy. During the 17th century, political and religious disputes raised the Puritan and Presbyterian faction to control of the church, but this ended with the Restoration. The contemporary Church of England still continues to contain several doctrinal strands, now generally known as Anglo-Catholic and Evangelical. This reflects early divisions. In recent times, tensions between theological conservatives and progressives find expression in debates over the current ordination of women and homosexuality within the church.\nThe governing structure of the church is based on the traditional parishes which are gathered into large districts (called dioceses) presided over by a bishop. The Archbishop of Canterbury is the primary bishop (Primate of All England), leading the Church of England and acting as a focus of unity for the wider Anglican Communion. The General Synod is the legislative body for the church and comprises bishops, clergy and laity. Although it is only the established church in England, its measures must be approved by both Houses of Parliament including the non-English members.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Hereford_Cathedral_Interior_May_2004.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Hooker-Statue.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/be/Flag_of_England.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Hereford_Cathedral_Interior_May_2004.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/TootBaldon_StLawrence_ParishChurch.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/Logo_of_the_Church_of_England.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Canterbury_cathedral.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Canterbury_Cathedral_-_Portal_Nave_Cross-spire.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Diocese_of_Gibraltar_in_Europe.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Church_in_Wales_flag.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Anglican_rose.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Justin_Welby_at_Seoul_Cathedral.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Canterbury_Cathedral%2C_view_of_the_Western_Towers_engraved_by_J.LeKeux_after_a_picture_by_G.Cattermole%2C_1821_edited.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Anglican_rose.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/St_Patrick%27s_saltire.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Flag_of_Scotland.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Dioceses_of_Church_of_England.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Rochester_cathedral_stained_glass_2.jpg"]	f	cover
73	Francis Drake	Sir Francis Drake, vice admiral (c. 1540 – 27 January 1596) was an English sea captain, privateer, navigator, slaver, and politician of the Elizabethan era. Drake carried out the second circumnavigation of the world, from 1577 to 1580.\nElizabeth I of England awarded Drake a knighthood in 1581. He was second-in-command of the English fleet against the Spanish Armada in 1588. He died of dysentery in January 1596 after unsuccessfully attacking San Juan, Puerto Rico.\nHis exploits were legendary, making him a hero to the English but a pirate to the Spaniards to whom he was known as El Draque. King Philip II was said to have offered a reward of 20,000 ducats, about £4 million (US$6.5M) by modern standards, for his life.\n\n	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Sir_Francis_Drake_And_His_Coat_Of_Arms.gif	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Drake	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Sir_Francis_Drake_And_His_Coat_Of_Arms.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Francis_Drake_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Drake_CA_1590.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Loutherbourg-Spanish_Armada.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Gheeraerts_Francis_Drake_1591.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/New_Albion._English_galleon_%22Golden_Hinde%22_by_Sir_Francis_Drake._Oil_on_canvas._60_x_90_cm..jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/NPG_Drake.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Pirate_Flag_of_Jack_Rackham.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Sfec_goldenhind02crop.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Sfdrake42.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/DRAKE_1577-1580.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/BurialOfDrakeTavistockMonument.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/DrakeKnightedTavistockMonument.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/DrakeArms.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/1590_or_later_Marcus_Gheeraerts%2C_Sir_Francis_Drake_Buckland_Abbey%2C_Devon.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/Boazio-Sir_Francis_Drakes_West_Indian_Voyage.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/ArgentAWyvernGules.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/DrakeStatueTavistock.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/DrakeMonumentTavistock.jpg"]	f	cover
75	Mary, Queen of Scots	Mary, Queen of Scots (7/8 December 1542 – 8 February 1587), also known as Mary Stuart or Mary I of Scotland, was queen regnant of Scotland from 14 December 1542 to 24 July 1567 and queen consort of France from 10 July 1559 to 5 December 1560.\nMary, the only surviving legitimate child of King James V of Scotland, was 6 days old when her father died and she acceded to the throne. She spent most of her childhood in France while Scotland was ruled by regents, and in 1558, she married the Dauphin of France, Francis. He ascended the French throne as King Francis II in 1559, and Mary briefly became queen consort of France, until his death on 5 December 1560. Widowed, Mary returned to Scotland, arriving in Leith on 19 August 1561. Four years later, she married her first cousin, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, but their union was unhappy. In February 1567, his residence was destroyed by an explosion, and Darnley was found murdered in the garden.\nJames Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, was generally believed to have orchestrated Darnley's death, but he was acquitted of the charge in April 1567, and the following month he married Mary. Following an uprising against the couple, Mary was imprisoned in Loch Leven Castle. On 24 July 1567, she was forced to abdicate in favour of James, her one-year-old son by Darnley. After an unsuccessful attempt to regain the throne, she fled southwards seeking the protection of her first cousin once removed, Queen Elizabeth I of England. Mary had previously claimed Elizabeth's throne as her own and was considered the legitimate sovereign of England by many English Catholics, including participants in a rebellion known as the Rising of the North. Perceiving her as a threat, Elizabeth had her confined in a number of castles and manor houses in the interior of England. After eighteen and a half years in custody, Mary was found guilty of plotting to assassinate Elizabeth, and was subsequently executed.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Mary_Stuart_tomb.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary,_Queen_of_Scots	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Execution_of_Mary%2C_Queen_of_Scots%2C_created_1613%2C_artist_unknown.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f5/Kirk_o%27_Field_contemporary_sketch.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Trial_of_Mary%2C_Queen_of_Scots_-_Documents_relating_to_Mary%2C_Queen_of_Scots_%281586%29%2C_f.569%2A_-_BL_Add_MS_48027.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/YoungMaryStuart.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Mary_Stuart_tomb.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Mary_Stuart_Queen.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Marysign.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Mary_of_Scotland_shilling_1553_692197.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Royal_Arms_of_Mary%2C_Queen_of_Scots%2C_France_%26_England.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Queen_Mary_death_mask_copy%2C_Falkland_Palace.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Royal_Arms_of_the_Kingdom_of_Scotland_%281559-1560%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Royal_Arms_of_the_Kingdom_of_Scotland_%281558-1559%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Tomb_effigy_of_Mary%2C_Queen_of_Scots_%28copy%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Royal_Arms_of_the_Kingdom_of_Scotland_%281560-1565%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Mary%2C_Queen_of_Scots_arms%2C_South_Leith_Parish_Church.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Linlithgow_Palace_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1416190.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Mary_Queen_of_Scots_by_Nicholas_Hilliard_1578.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/MaryQueenofScotsMourning.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Francois_Second_Mary_Stuart.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/James_Stewart_Earl_of_Moray.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/James_Hepburn%2C_1st_Duke_of_Orkney_and_Shetland%2C_4th_Earl_of_Bothwell.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Mary_Stuart_James_Darnley.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Mary_Stuart_James.jpg"]	f	cover
470	Charles I of England	Charles I (19 November 1600 – 30 January 1649) was monarch of the three kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland from 27 March 1625 until his execution in 1649.\nCharles was the second son of King James VI of Scotland, but after his father inherited the English throne in 1603, he moved to England, where he spent much of the rest of his life. He became heir apparent to the English, Irish and Scottish thrones on the death of his elder brother in 1612. An unsuccessful and unpopular attempt to marry him to a Spanish Habsburg princess culminated in an eight-month visit to Spain in 1623 that demonstrated the futility of the marriage negotiations. Two years later he married the Bourbon princess Henrietta Maria of France instead.\nAfter his succession, Charles quarrelled with the Parliament of England, which sought to curb his royal prerogative. Charles believed in the divine right of kings and thought he could govern according to his own conscience. Many of his subjects opposed his policies, in particular the levying of taxes without parliamentary consent, and perceived his actions as those of a tyrannical absolute monarch. His religious policies, coupled with his marriage to a Roman Catholic, generated the antipathy and mistrust of reformed groups such as the Puritans and Calvinists, who thought his views too Catholic. He supported high church ecclesiastics, such as Richard Montagu and William Laud, and failed to successfully aid Protestant forces during the Thirty Years' War. His attempts to force the Church of Scotland to adopt high Anglican practices led to the Bishops' Wars, strengthened the position of the English and Scottish parliaments and helped precipitate his own downfall.\nFrom 1642, Charles fought the armies of the English and Scottish parliaments in the English Civil War. After his defeat in 1645, he surrendered to a Scottish force that eventually handed him over to the English Parliament. Charles refused to accept his captors' demands for a constitutional monarchy, and temporarily escaped captivity in November 1647. Re-imprisoned on the Isle of Wight, Charles forged an alliance with Scotland, but by the end of 1648 Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army had consolidated its control over England. Charles was tried, convicted, and executed for high treason in January 1649. The monarchy was abolished and a republic called the Commonwealth of England was declared. In 1660, the English Interregnum ended when the monarchy was restored to Charles's son, Charles II.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/William_Laud.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Sir_Anthony_Van_Dyck_-_Charles_I_%281600-49%29_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Thomas_Wentworth%2C_1st_Earl_of_Strafford.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Wenceslas_Hollar_-_Charles_I_%28State_3%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/King_Charles_I_after_original_by_van_Dyck.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/King_Charles_I_by_Gerrit_van_Honthorst_sm.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Peter_Paul_Rubens_-_Landscape_with_Saint_George_and_the_Dragon_-_WGA20401.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Prince_of_Wales%27s_feathers_Badge.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Charles_Landseer_-_The_Eve_of_the_Battle_of_Edge_Hill%2C_1642_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Charles_I_at_his_trial.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Coat_of_Arms_of_Scotland_%281603-1649%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Coat_of_Arms_of_England_%281603-1649%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Contemporary_German_print_depicting_Charles_Is_beheading.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Coat_of_Arms_of_the_Stuart_Princes_of_Wales_%281610-1688%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/DelarocheCromwell.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Court-charles-I-sm.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/HenriettaMariaofFrance03.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Escutcheon_of_the_Duke_of_Rothesay.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Canterbury_Cathedral%2C_view_of_the_Western_Towers_engraved_by_J.LeKeux_after_a_picture_by_G.Cattermole%2C_1821_edited.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Arms_of_the_Duchy_of_Cornwall.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Charles_I_%28young%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Charles_I_%28Prince_of_Wales%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Anglican_rose.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Anthony_van_Dyck_-_Five_Eldest_Children_of_Charles_I_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Anne_of_Denmark%3B_King_Charles_I_when_Prince_of_Wales%3B_King_James_I_of_England_and_VI_of_Scotland_by_Simon_De_Passe_%282%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Anthony_van_Dyck_-_Charles_I_%281600-49%29_with_M._de_St_Antoine_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Charles_I_Insulted_by_Cromwell%27s_Soldiers.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Charles_I_AR_Sixpence_722625.jpg"]	f	cover
218	Jacques-Louis David	Jacques-Louis David (/ʒɑːkˈlwi ˈdɑːviːd/; French: [ʒak lwi david]) (30 August 1748 – 29 December 1825) was an influential French painter in the Neoclassical style, considered to be the preeminent painter of the era. In the 1780s his cerebral brand of history painting marked a change in taste away from Rococo frivolity toward a classical austerity and severity, heightened feeling chiming with the moral climate of the final years of the Ancien Régime.\nDavid later became an active supporter of the French Revolution and friend of Maximilien Robespierre (1758–1794), and was effectively a dictator of the arts under the French Republic. Imprisoned after Robespierre's fall from power, he aligned himself with yet another political regime upon his release, that of Napoleon I. It was at this time that he developed his Empire style, notable for its use of warm Venetian colours. After Napoleon's fall from power and the Bourbon revival, David exiled himself to Brussels, then in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, where he remained until his death. David had a large number of pupils, making him the strongest influence in French art of the early 19th century, especially academic Salon painting.	\N	\N	\N	http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GWqvCq-uZoc/TcHGfXaUM-I/AAAAAAAAAAM/cI046RBLIIs/s1600/dav_oath.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques-Louis_David	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Le_repr%C3%A9sentant_du_peuple_Fran%C3%A7ois_en_fonction2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Jacques-Louis_David%2C_The_Coronation_of_Napoleon_edit.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/L%C3%A9onidas_aux_Thermopyles_%28Jacques-Louis_David%29.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Madame_R%C3%A9camier_by_Jacques-Louis_David.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Jacques-Louis_David_008.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Jacques-Louis_David_013.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Jacques-Louis_David_018.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Le_Serment_du_Jeu_de_paume.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Jacques-Louis_David_-_The_Anger_of_Achilles_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Jacques-Louis_David_-_The_Emperor_Napoleon_in_His_Study_at_the_Tuileries_-_Google_Art_Project_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Jacques-Louis_David_-_The_Sisters_Z%C3%A9na%C3%AFde_and_Charlotte_Bonaparte_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Jacques-Louis_David_006.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Flag_of_Prussia_1892-1918.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/Emmanuel_Joseph_Siey%C3%A8s_-_crop.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Flag_of_Spain_%281785-1873_and_1875-1931%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Jacques-Louis_David%2C_Le_Serment_des_Horaces.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Helene_Paris_David.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Jacques-Louis_David_-_Marat_assassinated_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Jacques-Louis_David-_Andromache_Mourning_Hector.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Jacques-Louis_David_-_Mars_desarme_par_Venus.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Jacques-Louis_David_-_Marie_Antoinette_on_the_Way_to_the_Guillotine.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/The_Intervention_of_the_Sabine_Women.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Stanislaw_Kostka_Potocki_by_David.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Prinsenvlag.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Portrait_de_madame_de_Verninac_by_David_Louvre_RF1942-16_n2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Niobe_JacquesLouisDavid_1772_Dallas_Museum_of_Art.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Marguerite-Charlotte_David.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/David_-_The_Death_of_Socrates.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/David_-_Portrait_of_Monsieur_Lavoisier_and_His_Wife.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/David_Etienne_Maurice_Gerard.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/David_Brutus.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Cupid_and_psyche.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/David_-_Belisarius.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/David98.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/David_Vilain.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/David_Self_Portrait.jpg"]	f	cover
91	Louis XIV of France	Louis XIV (5 September 1638 – 1 September 1715), known as Louis the Great (Louis le Grand) or the Sun King (le Roi-Soleil), was a monarch of the House of Bourbon who ruled as King of France and Navarre from 1643 until his death. His reign of 72 years and 110 days is the longest of monarchs of major countries in European history.\nLouis began his personal rule of France in 1661 after the death of his chief minister, the Italian Cardinal Mazarin. An adherent of the theory of the divine right of kings, which advocates the divine origin of monarchical rule, Louis continued his predecessors' work of creating a centralized state governed from the capital. He sought to eliminate the remnants of feudalism persisting in parts of France and, by compelling many members of the nobility to inhabit his lavish Palace of Versailles, succeeded in pacifying the aristocracy, many members of which had participated in the Fronde rebellion during Louis's minority. By these means he became one of the most powerful French monarchs and consolidated a system of absolute monarchical rule in France that endured until the French Revolution.\nDuring Louis's reign, France was the leading European power and it fought three major wars: the Franco-Dutch War, the War of the League of Augsburg, and the War of the Spanish Succession. There were also two lesser conflicts: the War of Devolution and the War of the Reunions. Louis encouraged and benefited from the work of prominent political, military, and cultural figures such as Mazarin, Colbert, the Grand Condé, Turenne and Vauban, as well as Molière, Racine, Boileau, La Fontaine, Lully, Marais, Le Brun, Rigaud, Bossuet, Le Vau, Mansart, Charles and Claude Perrault, and Le Nôtre.\nUpon his death just days before his seventy-seventh birthday, Louis was succeeded by his five-year-old great-grandson, Louis XV. All of his intermediate heirs predeceased him: his son Louis, le Grand Dauphin; the Dauphin's eldest son Louis, Duke of Burgundy; and Burgundy's eldest son Louis, Duke of Brittany (the elder brother of Louis XV).	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Louis-xiv-lebrunl.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIV_of_France	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Louis_le_Grand%3B_Harnas.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Louis_le_Grand%3B_Rigaud_Hyacinthe.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Louis_XIV_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Louis_XIV_as_Child.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Louis_XIV_by_Robert_Nanteuil_1670.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Louis_XIV_of_France.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Louis14-Family.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Louis14-Versailles1685.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/LouisXIV-Bernini.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Louis_XIV_Coin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Chateau_Versailles_Galerie_des_Glaces.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Felipe_V%3B_Rey_de_Espa%C3%B1a.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Europe_map_1648.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/France_moderne.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/France_1552-1798.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Grand_Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/GarnierlouisXIV.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Le_roi_gouverne_par_lui-m%C3%AAme.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Grand_Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_France_%26_Navarre.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Louis14-F.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Louis-xiv-lebrunl.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/SiameseEmbassyToLouisXIV1686NicolasLarmessin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/S21c.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Royal_Standard_of_the_Kingdom_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Royal_Monogram_of_King_Louis_XIV_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Philippe_Buache_Carte_de_France_divisee_suivant_les_quatre_departements_de_Messieurs_les_secretaires_dEtat_07710637.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Nicolas_de_Largilli%C3%A8re_003.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Marshal_luxembourg.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Marie_Terese31.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/MEP_in_Paris.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Chateau-de-versailles-cour.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Bb85790a33.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Dual_Cypher_of_King_Louis_XIV_%26_Queen_Marie_Th%C3%A9r%C3%A8se_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Coat_of_Arms_of_the_Dauphin_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/046CupolaSPietro.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Ambassade_Perse_aupr%C3%A8s_de_Louis_XIV.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/1680_van_der_Meulen_Louis_XIV_bei_Lobith_anagoria.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Europe_green_light.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Equestrian_portrait_louis_xiv_1692.jpg"]	f	contain
355	Chaos theory	Chaos theory is a field of study in mathematics, with applications in several disciplines including meteorology, physics, engineering, economics, biology, and philosophy. Chaos theory studies the behavior of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions—a paradigm popularly referred to as the butterfly effect. Small differences in initial conditions (such as those due to rounding errors in numerical computation) yield widely diverging outcomes for such dynamical systems, rendering long-term prediction impossible in general. This happens even though these systems are deterministic, meaning that their future behavior is fully determined by their initial conditions, with no random elements involved. In other words, the deterministic nature of these systems does not make them predictable. This behavior is known as deterministic chaos, or simply chaos. This was summarized by Edward Lorenz as follows:\n\nChaos: When the present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future.\n\nChaotic behavior can be observed in many natural systems, such as weather. Explanation of such behavior may be sought through analysis of a chaotic mathematical model, or through analytical techniques such as recurrence plots and Poincaré maps.	\N	\N	\N	http://www.pon.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/images/posts/chaos-theory-250.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Lorenz_attractor_yb.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Airplane_vortex_edit.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/LogisticMap_BifurcationDiagram.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Complex-adaptive-system.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Chaos_Topological_Mixing.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Double-compound-pendulum.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/BML_N%3D200_P%3D32.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Chaos_Sensitive_Dependence.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Barnsley_fern_plotted_with_VisSim.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/TwoLorenzOrbits.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Textile_cone.JPG"]	f	cover
431	Kamikaze	The Kamikaze (神風?, literally: "Spirit wind"; common translation: "Divine wind") [kamikaꜜze] ( ), official name: Tokubetsu Kōgekitai (特別攻撃隊, literally: "Special attack unit"?), abbreviated as Tokkō Tai (特攻隊?) and used as a verb as Tokkō (特攻?) ("special attack") were suicide attacks by military aviators from the Empire of Japan against Allied naval vessels in the closing stages of the Pacific campaign of World War II, designed to destroy warships more effectively than was possible with conventional attacks. Numbers quoted vary, but at least 47 Allied vessels, from PT boats to escort carriers, were sunk by kamikaze attacks, and about 300 damaged. During World War II, nearly 4,000 kamikaze pilots were killed. About 14% of kamikaze attacks managed to hit a ship.\nKamikaze aircraft were essentially pilot-guided explosive missiles, purpose-built or converted from conventional aircraft. Pilots would attempt to crash their aircraft into enemy ships in what was called a "Body Attack" (体当たり; 体当り, taiatari) in planes laden with some combination of explosives, bombs, torpedoes and full fuel tanks; accuracy was much better than a conventional attack, and the payload larger. A kamikaze could sustain damage which would disable a conventional attacker and still achieve its objective. The goal of crippling or destroying large numbers of Allied ships, particularly aircraft carriers, was considered to justify sacrificing pilots and aircraft.\nThese attacks, which began in October 1944, followed several critical military defeats for the Japanese. They had long lost aerial dominance due to outdated aircraft and the loss of experienced pilots. On a macroeconomic scale, Japan experienced a decreasing capacity to wage war, and a rapidly declining industrial capacity relative to the United States. The Japanese government expressed its reluctance to surrender. In combination, these factors led to the use of kamikaze tactics as Allied forces advanced towards the Japanese home islands.\n\nWhile the term "kamikaze" usually refers to the aerial strikes, it has also been applied to various other suicide attacks. The Japanese military also used or made plans for non-aerial Japanese Special Attack Units, including those involving submarines, human torpedoes, speedboats and divers. Nazi Germany formed its own group of suicide aircraft pilots called the Leonidas Squadron, but German commanders were more reluctant to use them.\nThe tradition of death instead of defeat, capture, and perceived shame was deeply entrenched in Japanese military culture. It was one of the primary traditions in the samurai life and the Bushido code: loyalty and honour until death.\n\n	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Chiran_high_school_girls_wave_kamikaze_pilot.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamikaze	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/10/Kamikaze.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/USS_Intrepid_CV-11_kamikaze_strike.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/USS_Louisville_hit_by_kamikaze.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/USS_White_Plains_attack_by_Tokkotai_unit_25.10.1945_kk1a.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/USS_Bunker_Hill_hit_by_two_Kamikazes.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Imperial_Seal_of_Japan.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/HMS_Formidable_%2867%29_on_fire_1945.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Kamikaze_zero.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Kamikaze-ManchesterMSI_crop.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/MokoShurai.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Merchant_flag_of_Japan_%281870%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/SL_Exp_5.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/USS_Columbia_hit_by_kamikaze.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/USS_Columbia_attacked_by_kamikaze.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Chiran_high_school_girls_wave_kamikaze_pilot.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/CV09_Essex_USG-80-G-273032-.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/D4Y_tail_kitkun.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/D4Y_Yoshinori_Yamaguchi_col.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/72nd_Shinbu_1945_Kamikaze.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Arima_Masafumi.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/A6M5_52c_Kyushu.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/HMAS_Australia_bridge.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Ensign_Kiyoshi_Ogawa_hit_Bunker_Hill_%28new%29.png"]	f	cover
471	The Protectorate	The Protectorate was the period during the Interregnum when England (which at that time included Wales), Ireland and Scotland were governed by a Lord Protector. The Protectorate began in 1653 when, following the dissolution of the Rump Parliament and then Barebone's Parliament, Oliver Cromwell was appointed Lord Protector of the Commonwealth under the terms of the Instrument of Government. In 1659 the Protectorate Parliament was dissolved by the Committee of Safety as Richard Cromwell, who had succeeded his father as Lord Protector, was unable to keep control of the Parliament and the Army. This marked the end of the Protectorate and the start of a second period of rule by the Rump Parliament as the legislative and the Council of State as the executive.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protectorate	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Flag_of_the_Commonwealth_%281658-1660%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Coat_of_Arms_of_the_Protectorate_%281653%E2%80%931659%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/RichardCromwell.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Oliver_Cromwell_by_Samuel_Cooper.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Arms_of_the_Commonwealth_of_England%2C_Scotland_and_Ireland.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Coat_of_Arms_of_England_%281558-1603%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Arms_of_the_Commonwealth_of_England.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/be/Flag_of_England.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Standard_of_Oliver_Cromwell_%281653%E2%80%931659%29.svg"]	f	cover
472	Charles II of England	Charles II (29 May 1630 – 6 February 1685) was monarch of the three kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland.\nCharles II's father, King Charles I, was executed at Whitehall on 30 January 1649, at the climax of the English Civil War. Although the Parliament of Scotland proclaimed Charles II King of Great Britain and Ireland in Edinburgh on 6 February 1649, the English Parliament instead passed a statute that made any such proclamation unlawful. England entered the period known as the English Interregnum or the English Commonwealth, and the country was a de facto republic, led by Oliver Cromwell. Cromwell defeated Charles II at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651, and Charles fled to mainland Europe. Cromwell became virtual dictator of England, Scotland and Ireland, and Charles spent the next nine years in exile in France, the United Provinces and the Spanish Netherlands.\nA political crisis that followed the death of Cromwell in 1658 resulted in the restoration of the monarchy, and Charles was invited to return to Britain. On 29 May 1660, his 30th birthday, he was received in London to public acclaim. After 1660, all legal documents were dated as if he had succeeded his father as king in 1649.\nCharles's English parliament enacted laws known as the Clarendon Code, designed to shore up the position of the re-established Church of England. He acquiesced to the Clarendon Code even though he favoured a policy of religious tolerance. The major foreign policy issue of his early reign was the Second Anglo-Dutch War. In 1670, he entered into the secret treaty of Dover, an alliance with his first cousin King Louis XIV of France. Louis agreed to aid Charles in the Third Anglo-Dutch War and pay Charles a pension, and Charles secretly promised to convert to Catholicism at an unspecified future date. Charles attempted to introduce religious freedom for Catholics and Protestant dissenters with his 1672 Royal Declaration of Indulgence, but the English Parliament forced him to withdraw it. In 1679, Titus Oates's revelations of a supposed "Popish Plot" sparked the Exclusion Crisis when it was revealed that Charles's brother and heir (James, Duke of York) was a Catholic. The crisis saw the birth of the pro-exclusion Whig and anti-exclusion Tory parties. Charles sided with the Tories, and, following the discovery of the Rye House Plot to murder Charles and James in 1683, some Whig leaders were killed or forced into exile. Charles dissolved the English Parliament in 1681, and ruled alone until his death on 6 February 1685. He was received into the Catholic Church on his deathbed.\nCharles II was popularly known as the Merry Monarch, in reference to both the liveliness and hedonism of his court and the general relief at the return to normality after over a decade of rule by Oliver Cromwell and the Puritans. Charles's wife, Catherine of Braganza, bore no live children, but Charles acknowledged at least twelve illegitimate children by various mistresses. As his illegitimate children were excluded from the succession, he was succeeded by his brother James.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_II_of_England	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Coat_of_Arms_of_Scotland_%281660-1689%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Coat_of_Arms_of_England_%281660-1689%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Escutcheon_of_the_Duke_of_Rothesay.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Coat_of_Arms_of_the_Stuart_Princes_of_Wales_%281610-1688%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/King_Charles_II_by_John_Riley.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/King_Charles_II_by_John_Michael_Wright_or_studio.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/The_Scots_Holding_Their_Young_King%27s_Nose_To_the_Grindstone.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Rhc-charles2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/The_arrival_of_King_Charles_II_of_England_in_Rotterdam%2C_may_24_1660_%28Lieve_Pietersz._Verschuier%2C_1665%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Charles_II_%28de_Champaigne%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/CharlesIISig.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Charles_II_of_England_in_Coronation_robes.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Charles_II_Prince_of_Wales_Egmont.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Arms_of_the_Duchy_of_Cornwall.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/CharlesII1667Medal.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Charles-pineapple.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Charles_II_when_Prince_of_Wales_by_William_Dobson%2C_1642.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Charles_II_statue._Parliament_Square_Edinburgh.JPG"]	f	cover
474	Baroque music	Baroque music is a style of Western art music composed from approximately 1600 to 1750. This era followed the Renaissance, and was followed in turn by the Classical era. The word "baroque" comes from the Portuguese word barroco, meaning misshapen pearl, a negative description of the ornate and heavily ornamented music of this period. Later, the name came to apply also to the architecture of the same period.\nBaroque music forms a major portion of the "classical music" canon, being widely studied, performed, and listened to. Composers of the Baroque era include Johann Sebastian Bach, George Frideric Handel, Alessandro Scarlatti, Domenico Scarlatti, Antonio Vivaldi, Henry Purcell, Georg Philipp Telemann, Jean-Baptiste Lully, Arcangelo Corelli, Tomaso Albinoni, François Couperin, Denis Gaultier, Claudio Monteverdi, Heinrich Schütz, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Jan Dismas Zelenka, and Johann Pachelbel.\nThe Baroque period saw the creation of tonality. During the period, composers and performers used more elaborate musical ornamentation, made changes in musical notation, and developed new instrumental playing techniques. Baroque music expanded the size, range, and complexity of instrumental performance, and also established opera, cantata, oratorio, concerto, and sonata as musical genres. Many musical terms and concepts from this era are still in use today.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque_music	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Louis_XIV_of_France.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Johann_Sebastian_Bach.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Retrato_de_Handel.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Vivaldi.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Telemann_4.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Baschenis_-_Musical_Instruments.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Bachsiegel.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Claudio_Monteverdi.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Ceskystage.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Adolph_Menzel_-_Fl%C3%B6tenkonzert_Friedrichs_des_Gro%C3%9Fen_in_Sanssouci_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Pannini%2C_Giovanni_Paolo_-_Musical_F%C3%AAte_-_1747.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Attribu%C3%A9_%C3%A0_Joseph_Aved%2C_Portrait_de_Jean-Philippe_Rameau_%28vers_1728%29_-_001.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Arcangelo_corelli.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Thomas_Augustine_Arne.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Henry_Purcell_by_John_Closterman.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Jacopo_Peri_1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Harpsichord_VitalJulianFrey.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg"]	f	cover
475	Classical music	Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music (both liturgical and secular). It encompasses a broad period from roughly the 11th century to the present day. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common practice period.\nEuropean music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to prescribe to the performer the pitch, speed, meter, individual rhythms and exact execution of a piece of music. This leaves less room for practices such as improvisation and ad libitum ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular music.\nThe term "classical music" did not appear until the early 19th century, in an attempt to distinctly "canonize" the period from Johann Sebastian Bach to Beethoven as a golden age. The earliest reference to "classical music" recorded by the Oxford English Dictionary is from about 1836.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/White_mensural_notation.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Concertband.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Classical_music_composers_montage.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Dublin_Philharmonic_Orchestra_performing_Tchaikovsky%27s_Symphony_No_4_in_Charlotte%2C_North_Carolina.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/CordierColor.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/%27A%27_%28PSF%29.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Baschenis_-_Musical_Instruments.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Audio_a.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Vielle.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/Haydnportrait.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1c/Stravinsky_picasso.png"]	f	cover
477	Scientific Awakening	During the Renaissance, great advances occurred in geography, astronomy, chemistry, physics, mathematics, manufacturing, and engineering. The rediscovery of ancient scientific texts was accelerated after the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, and the invention of printing which would democratize learning and allow a faster propagation of new ideas. But, at least in its initial period, some see the Renaissance as one of scientific backwardness. Historians like George Sarton and Lynn Thorndike have criticized how the Renaissance affected science, arguing that progress was slowed for some amount of time. Humanists favored human-centered subjects like politics and history over study of natural philosophy or applied mathematics. Others have focused on the positive influence of the Renaissance, pointing to factors like the rediscovery of lost or obscure texts and the increased emphasis on the study of language and the correct reading of texts.\nMarie Boas Hall coined the term Scientific Renaissance to designate the early phase of the Scientific Revolution, 1450–1630. More recently, Peter Dear has argued for a two-phase model of early modern science: a Scientific Renaissance of the 15th and 16th centuries, focused on the restoration of the natural knowledge of the ancients; and a Scientific Revolution of the 17th century, when scientists shifted from recovery to innovation.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Libr0310.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science_in_the_Renaissance	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/The_Anatomy_Lesson.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Sanzio_01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Galilee.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Libr0310.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour.jpg"]	f	cover
354	Butterfly effect	In chaos theory, the butterfly effect is the sensitive dependency on initial conditions in which a small change at one place in a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state. The name of the effect, coined by Edward Lorenz, is derived from the theoretical example of a hurricane's formation being contingent on whether or not a distant butterfly had flapped its wings several weeks earlier.\nAlthough the butterfly effect may appear to be an unlikely behavior, it is exhibited by very simple systems. For example, a ball placed at the crest of a hill may roll into any surrounding valley depending on, among other things, slight differences in its initial position.\nThe butterfly effect is a common trope in fiction, especially in scenarios involving time travel. Additionally, works of fiction that involve points at which the storyline diverges during a seemingly minor event, resulting in a significantly different outcome than would have occurred without the divergence, are an example of the butterfly effect.	\N	\N	\N	http://nameetshetty.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/butterfly-effect-lay-out.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/LorenzCoordinatesSmall.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/TwoLorenzOrbits.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Sensitive-dependency.svg"]	f	cover
478	The Leviathan	Leviathan or The Matter, Forme and Power of a Common Wealth Ecclesiasticall and Civil — commonly referred to as Leviathan — is a book written by Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679) and published in 1651. Its name derives from the biblical Leviathan. The work concerns the structure of society and legitimate government, and is regarded as one of the earliest and most influential examples of social contract theory. Leviathan ranks as a classic western work on statecraft comparable to Machiavelli's The Prince. Written during the English Civil War (1642–1651), Leviathan argues for a social contract and rule by an absolute sovereign. Hobbes wrote that civil war and the brute situation of a state of nature ("the war of all against all") could only be avoided by strong undivided government.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviathan_(book)	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Leviathan_by_Thomas_Hobbes.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg"]	f	cover
481	George II of Great Britain	George II (George Augustus; German: Georg II. August; 30 October / 9 November 1683O.S./N.S. – 25 October 1760) was King of Great Britain and Ireland, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg (Hanover) and Prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire from 11 June 1727 (O.S.) until his death.\nGeorge was the last British monarch born outside Great Britain: he was born and brought up in northern Germany. In 1701, his grandmother, Sophia of Hanover, became second in line to the British throne after about 50 Catholics higher in line were excluded by the Act of Settlement, which restricted the succession to Protestants. After the deaths of Sophia and Anne, Queen of Great Britain, in 1714, his father George I, Elector of Hanover, inherited the British throne. In the first years of his father's reign as king, George was associated with opposition politicians, until they re-joined the governing party in 1720.\nAs king from 1727, George exercised little control over British domestic policy, which was largely controlled by the Parliament of Great Britain. As elector, he spent 12 summers in Hanover, where he had more direct control over government policy. He had a difficult relationship with his eldest son, Frederick, who supported the parliamentary opposition. During the War of the Austrian Succession, George participated at the Battle of Dettingen in 1743, and thus became the last British monarch to lead an army in battle. In 1745, supporters of the Catholic claimant to the British throne, James Francis Edward Stuart ("The Old Pretender"), led by James's son Charles Edward Stuart ("The Young Pretender" or "Bonnie Prince Charlie"), attempted and failed to depose George in the last of the Jacobite rebellions. After Prince Frederick died unexpectedly in 1751, George's grandson, George III, became heir apparent and ultimately king.\nFor two centuries after the death of George II, history tended to view him with disdain, concentrating on his mistresses, short temper, and boorishness. Since then, some scholars have re-assessed his legacy and conclude that he held and exercised influence in foreign policy and military appointments.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_II_of_Great_Britain	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Sophie_Dorothea_Prinzessin_von_Ahlden.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/The_Thames_at_Horseferry1710.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/George2coin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Floral_Badge_of_Great_Britain.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/George_II.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/GeorgeIIWootton1743.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/George_II_by_Thomas_Hudson.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/George_II_1755-1767.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/King_George_II_by_Charles_Jervas.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/George_II_statue_1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Royal_Arms_of_Great_Britain_%281714-1801%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Prince_of_Wales%27s_feathers_Badge.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Coat_of_Arms_of_the_Hanoverian_Princes_of_Wales_%281714-1760%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Coat_of_Arms_of_Great_Britain_%281714-1801%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Firma_del_Rey_George_II.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Escutcheon_of_the_Duke_of_Rothesay.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Arms_of_the_Duchy_of_Cornwall.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Coat_of_Arms_of_George_I_Louis%2C_Elector_of_Hanover_%281698-1708%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Coat_of_Arms_of_George_I_Louis%2C_Elector_of_Hanover_%281698-1708%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Flag_of_Hanover_1837-1866.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Flag_of_Hanover_%281692%29.svg"]	f	cover
482	Classical antiquity	Classical antiquity (also the classical era, classical period or classical age) is a broad term for a long period of cultural history centered on the Mediterranean Sea, comprising the interlocking civilizations of ancient Greece and ancient Rome, collectively known as the Greco-Roman world. It is the period in which Greek and Roman society flourished and wielded great influence throughout Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.\nIt is conventionally taken to begin with the earliest-recorded Greek poetry of Homer (8th–7th century BC), and continues through the emergence of Christianity and the decline of the Roman Empire (5th century AD). It ends with the dissolution of classical culture at the close of Late Antiquity (AD 300–600), blending into the Early Middle Ages (AD 600–1000). Such a wide sampling of history and territory covers many disparate cultures and periods. "Classical antiquity" may refer also to an idealised vision among later people of what was, in Edgar Allan Poe's words, "the glory that was Greece, the grandeur that was Rome!"\nThe culture of the ancient Greeks, together with some influences from the ancient Orient, prevailed throughout classical antiquity as the basis of art,  philosophy, society, and educational ideals.  These ideals were preserved and imitated by the Romans.  This Greco-Roman cultural foundation has been immensely influential on the language, politics, educational systems, philosophy, science, art, and architecture of the modern world: From the surviving fragments of classical antiquity, a revival movement was gradually formed from the 14th century onwards which came to be known later in Europe as the Renaissance, and again resurgent during various neo-classical revivals in the 18th and 19th centuries.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Parthenon_from_west.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Map_athenian_empire_431_BC-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/RomanEmpire_117.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/People_icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/2006_01_21_Ath%C3%A8nes_Parth%C3%A9non.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Extent_of_the_Roman_Republic_and_the_Roman_Empire_between_218_BC_and_117_AD.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Etruscan_civilization_map.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Roman_Empires_476AD.svg"]	f	cover
170	Isaac Newton	Sir Isaac Newton PRS MP (/ˈnjuːtən/; 25 December 1642 – 20 March 1727) was an English physicist and mathematician who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all time and as a key figure in the scientific revolution. His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica ("Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy"), first published in 1687, laid the foundations for classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics and shares credit with Gottfried Leibniz for the invention of infinitesimal calculus.\nNewton's Principia formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation, which dominated scientists' view of the physical universe for the next three centuries. It also demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies could be described by the same principles. By deriving Kepler's laws of planetary motion from his mathematical description of gravity, and then using the same principles to account for the trajectories of comets and other phenomena, Newton removed the last doubts about the validity of the heliocentric model of the cosmos.\nNewton built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a theory of colour based on the observation that a prism decomposes white light into the many colours of the visible spectrum. He also formulated an empirical law of cooling, studied the speed of sound, and introduced the notion of a Newtonian fluid. In addition to his work on calculus, as a mathematician Newton contributed to the study of power series, generalised the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents, and developed Newton's method for approximating the roots of a function.\nNewton was a fellow of Trinity College and the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. He was a devout but unorthodox Christian and, unusually for a member of the Cambridge faculty of the day, he refused to take holy orders in the Church of England, perhaps because he privately rejected the doctrine of the Trinity. In addition to his work on the mathematical sciences, Newton also dedicated much of his time to the study of biblical chronology and alchemy, but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his death. In his later life, Newton became president of the Royal Society. He also served the British government as Warden and Master of the Royal Mint.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Sound-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Supposedly_Isaac_Newton%27s_apple_tree.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Newton-letter-to-briggs_03.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Newton-WilliamBlake.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Newton_by_Eduardo_Paolozzi_2003-03-10.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Newton_25.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/NewtonsTelescopeReplica.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/NewtonsPrincipia.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Office-book.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Newtons_apple.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Sir_Isaac_Newton_by_Sir_Godfrey_Kneller%2C_Bt.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Isaac_Newton.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Isaac_Newton_signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Isaac_Newton_grave_in_Westminster_Abbey.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Bolton-newton.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/ENG_COA_Newton.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Dispersive_Prism_Illustration.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Newton%27s_tree%2C_Botanic_Gardens%2C_Cambridge.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Isaac_Newton_statue.jpg"]	f	60%
225	Ludwig van Beethoven	Ludwig van Beethoven (/ˈlʊdvɪɡ væn ˈbeɪ.toʊvən/; German: [ˈluːtvɪç fan ˈbeːt.hoːfən] ( ); baptised 17 December 1770 – 26 March 1827) was a German composer and pianist. A crucial figure in the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras in Western art music, he remains one of the most famous and influential of all composers. His best-known compositions include 9 symphonies, 5 concertos for piano, 32 piano sonatas, and 16 string quartets. He also composed other chamber music, choral works (including the celebrated Missa Solemnis), and songs.\nBorn in Bonn, then the capital of the Electorate of Cologne and part of the Holy Roman Empire, Beethoven displayed his musical talents at an early age and was taught by his father Johann van Beethoven and Christian Gottlob Neefe. During his first 22 years in Bonn, Beethoven intended to study with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and befriended Joseph Haydn. Beethoven moved to Vienna in 1792 and began studying with Haydn, quickly gaining a reputation as a virtuoso pianist. He lived in Vienna until his death. In about 1800 his hearing began to deteriorate, and by the last decade of his life he was almost totally deaf. He gave up conducting and performing in public but continued to compose; many of his most admired works come from this period.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Beethoven.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Zentralfriedhof_Vienna_-_Beethoven.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Speakerlink-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Thirteen-year-old_Beethoven.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Universit%C3%A4t_Bonn.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Masque_de_Beethoven.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Office-book.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Rudolf-habsburg-olmuetz.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Beethoven_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Beethoven_Riedel_1801.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Beethoven_monument_bonn_muensterplatz_2008.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Beethoven_house_of_birth_Bonn_2008.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/De-Ludwig_van_Beethoven.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Beethovendeathmask.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Gnome-mime-audio-openclipart.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/FurElise.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Ludwig_van_Beethoven_-_Symphonie_5_c-moll_-_1._Allegro_con_brio.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Lidwig_van_Beethoven.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Beethoven_bust_statue_by_Hagen.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Beethoven_3.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Beethoven_-_Piano_sonata_in_C_minor_%28opus_111%29%2C_movement_1.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Beethoven_Hornemann.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Beethoven_7.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/%27A%27_%28PSF%29.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/BeethovenWithLyreGuitar%28_W._J._Mahler_-_1804%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Beethoven.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Beethoven_M%C3%A4hler_1815.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Beethoven_Letronne.jpg"]	f	60%
351	Uncertainty principle	In quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle is any of a variety of mathematical inequalities asserting a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle known as complementary variables, such as position x and momentum p, can be known simultaneously. For instance, in 1927, Werner Heisenberg stated that the more precisely the position of some particle is determined, the less precisely its momentum can be known, and vice versa. The formal inequality relating the standard deviation of position σx and the standard deviation of momentum σp was derived by Earle Hesse Kennard later that year and by Hermann Weyl in 1928,\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\nThe original heuristic argument that such a limit should exist was given by Heisenberg, after whom it is sometimes named the Heisenberg principle. This ascribes the uncertainty in the measurable quantities to the jolt-like disturbance triggered by the act of observation. Though widely repeated in textbooks, this physical argument is now known to be fundamentally misleading. While the act of measurement does lead to uncertainty, the loss of precision is less than that predicted by Heisenberg's argument; the formal mathematical result remains valid, however.\nHistorically, the uncertainty principle has been confused with a somewhat similar effect in physics, called the observer effect, which notes that measurements of certain systems cannot be made without affecting the systems. Heisenberg offered such an observer effect at the quantum level (see below) as a physical "explanation" of quantum uncertainty. It has since become clear, however, that the uncertainty principle is inherent in the properties of all wave-like systems, and that it arises in quantum mechanics simply due to the matter wave nature of all quantum objects. Thus, the uncertainty principle actually states a fundamental property of quantum systems, and is not a statement about the observational success of current technology. It must be emphasized that measurement does not mean only a process in which a physicist-observer takes part, but rather any interaction between classical and quantum objects regardless of any observer.\nSince the uncertainty principle is such a basic result in quantum mechanics, typical experiments in quantum mechanics routinely observe aspects of it. Certain experiments, however, may deliberately test a particular form of the uncertainty principle as part of their main research program. These include, for example, tests of number-phase uncertainty relations in superconducting or quantum optics systems. Applications dependent on the uncertainty principle for their operation include extremely low noise technology such as that required in gravitational-wave interferometers.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Heisenbergbohr.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/68/Position_and_momentum_of_a_Gaussian_initial_state_for_a_QHO%2C_wide.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5c/Position_and_momentum_of_a_Gaussian_initial_state_for_a_QHO%2C_narrow.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/28/Wave_function_of_a_Gaussian_state_moving_at_constant_momentum.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Uncertainty_principle.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Propagation_of_a_de_broglie_wavepacket.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Heisenberg_gamma_ray_microscope.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Propagation_of_a_de_broglie_plane_wave.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Heisenbergbohr.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/db/Sequential_superposition_of_plane_waves.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fe/Position_and_momentum_of_a_Gaussian_initial_state_for_a_QHO%2C_balanced.gif"]	f	cover
483	Neoclassicism	Neoclassicism (from Greek νέος nèos and κλασσικός klassikòs classicus) is the name given to Western movements in the decorative and visual arts, literature, theatre, music, and architecture that draw inspiration from the "classical" art and culture of Ancient Greece or Ancient Rome. The main Neoclassical movement coincided with the 18th century Age of Enlightenment, and continued into the early 19th century, latterly competing with Romanticism. In architecture, the style continued throughout the 19th and 20th centuries and into the 21st.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Psyche_revived_Louvre_MR1777.jpg/602px-Psyche_revived_Louvre_MR1777.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassicism	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Table_Empire.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Th%C3%A9r%C3%A9sa_Cabarrus.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Psyche_revived_Louvre_MR1777.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Schadow_Herkules_und_die_Rosse_des_Diomedes_2.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Schermerhorn.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Sergelfaun.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Museo_delle_porcellane_di_Firenze%2C_servizio_di_elisa_baciocchi%2C_sevres%2C_1809-1810_03.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Nydia-3%2C_Randolph_Rogers.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Ostdv5.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Portrait_de_madame_de_Verninac_by_David_Louvre_RF1942-16_n2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Discobole_lan%C3%A7ant_le_disque-ChatsworthHouse.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/David-Oath_of_the_Horatii-1784.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/FuseliArtistMovedtoDespair.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Emotions_X.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/IngresOdipusAndSphinx.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Home_House_05.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Johann_Joachim_Winckelmann_%28Anton_von_Maron_1768%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Jean-Laurent_Mosnier_01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Madame_R%C3%A9camier_painted_by_Jacques-Louis_David_in_1800.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Le_triomphe_de_1810_jean-pierre_cortot.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Voltaire_by_Jean-Antoine_Houdon_%281778%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Vase-BlackBasalt-Wedgwood-BMA.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Asmus-jakob-carstens-night-and-her-children-sleep-and-death.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Antichina_piranese.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Canova-Hebe_30_degree_view.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/BLW_Egg_Cup_%281%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/%2820%29_Flaxman_Ilias_1795%2C_Zeichnung_1793%2C_194_x_338_mm.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Angelica_Kauffmann_-_Venus_Induces_Helen_to_Fall_in_Love_with_Paris_-_WGA12099.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/5th_Duke_of_Bedford.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Copernicus_by_Thorwaldsen_Warsaw_02.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Malmaison_-_Appartement_de_Jos%C3%A9phine_003.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/74/Hamilton_Palmyra.JPG"]	f	cover
223	Joseph Haydn	Franz Joseph Haydn (/ˈdʒoʊzəf ˈhaɪdən/; German: [ˈjoːzɛf ˈhaɪdən] ( ); 31 March 1732 – 31 May 1809), known as Joseph Haydn, was one of the most prominent and prolific composers of the Classical period. He was instrumental in the development of chamber music such as the piano trio and his contributions to musical form have earned him the epithets "Father of the Symphony" and "Father of the String Quartet".\nA lifelong resident of Austria, Haydn spent much of his career as a court musician for the wealthy Esterházy family at their remote estate. This isolated him from other composers and trends in music until the later part of his life, when he was, as he put it, "forced to become original". At the time of his death, aged 77, he was one of the most celebrated composers in Europe.\nJoseph Haydn was the brother of Michael Haydn – himself a highly regarded composer – and Johann Evangelist Haydn, a tenor. He was also a friend of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and a teacher of Ludwig van Beethoven.	\N	\N	\N	http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-R6bhX_uKBSc/T0djXI8ZmcI/AAAAAAAAARc/T07eCUbOnNk/s1600/Haydn.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Haydn	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/The_Clock.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/WhereHaydnLived.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Haydn_Sonata_Hob_XVI_40_1st_movement.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Haydn_Piano_Sonata_No62_HobXVI-52_Mvt2.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/Haydnportrait.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Haydn_Sonata_Hob_XVI_40_2nd_movement.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Joseph_Haydn.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/HaydnsHouseInVienna.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Mozart_Lange.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/Joseph_Haydn_Signature.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Office-book.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Nikolaus_Esterhazy.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Fert%C5%91d_-_The_Eszterh%C3%A1zy_Castle_or_Palace.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Eduard_Gurk_Sankt_Stephan.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Gnome-mime-audio-openclipart.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Franz_Joseph_Haydn.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Beethoven_Riedel_1801.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/CELLO_LIVE_PERFORMANCES_JOHN_MICHEL-Haydn_Cello_Concerto_in_D_3rd_mvt_.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/CELLO_LIVE_PERFORMANCES_JOHN_MICHEL-HAYDN_CELLO_CONCERTO_in_D_1_recapcad.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Haydn_Piano_Sonata_No62_HobXVI-52_Mvt1.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Haydn_Kaiserlied_Reinschrift.jpg"]	f	cover
264	Romanticism	Romanticism (also the Romantic era or the Romantic period) was an artistic, literary, and intellectual movement that originated in Europe toward the end of the 18th century and in most areas was at its peak in the approximate period from 1800 to 1850. Partly a reaction to the Industrial Revolution, it was also a revolt against the aristocratic social and political norms of the Age of Enlightenment and a reaction against the scientific rationalization of nature. It was embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, and literature, but had a major impact on historiography, education and the natural sciences. Its effect on politics was considerable and complex; while for much of the peak Romantic period it was associated with liberalism and radicalism, its long-term effect on the growth of nationalism was probably more significant.\nThe movement validated intense emotion as an authentic source of aesthetic experience, placing new emphasis on such emotions as apprehension, horror and terror, and awe—especially that which is experienced in confronting the sublimity of untamed nature and its picturesque qualities: both new aesthetic categories. It elevated folk art and ancient custom to a noble status, made spontaneity a desirable characteristic (as in the musical impromptu), and argued for a "natural" epistemology of human activities, as conditioned by nature in the form of language and customary usage. Romanticism reached beyond the rational and Classicist ideal models to raise a revived medievalism and elements of art and narrative perceived to be authentically medieval in an attempt to escape the confines of population growth, urban sprawl, and industrialism. Romanticism embraced the exotic, the unfamiliar, and the distant in modes more authentic than Rococo chinoiserie, harnessing the power of the imagination to envision and to escape.\nAlthough the movement was rooted in the German Sturm und Drang movement, which prized intuition and emotion over the rationalism of the Enlightenment, the events of and ideologies that led to the French Revolution planted the seeds from which both Romanticism and the Counter-Enlightenment sprouted. The confines of the Industrial Revolution also had their influence on Romanticism, which was in part an escape from modern realities. Indeed, in the second half of the 19th century, "Realism" was offered as a polarized opposite to Romanticism. Romanticism assigned a high value to the achievements of 'heroic' individualists and artists, whose pioneering examples, it maintained, would raise the quality of society. It also vouched for the individual imagination as a critical authority allowed of freedom from classical notions of form in art. There was a strong recourse to historical and natural inevitability, a Zeitgeist, in the representation of its ideas.	\N	\N	\N	http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_fOFRUKN3H8/T59N9ydTvLI/AAAAAAAADI0/IMXUJRGvL40/s1242/turner_slave_ship_1840.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/The_Wood_of_the_Self-Murderers.jpg",

360	Édouard Manet	Édouard Manet (US /mæˈneɪ/ or UK /ˈmæneɪ/; French: [edwaʁ manɛ]; 23 January 1832 – 30 April 1883) was a French painter. He was one of the first 19th-century artists to paint modern life, and a pivotal figure in the transition from Realism to Impressionism.\nHis early masterworks, The Luncheon on the Grass (Le déjeuner sur l'herbe) and Olympia, both 1863, caused great controversy and served as rallying points for the young painters who would create Impressionism. Today, these are considered watershed paintings that mark the genesis of modern art.	\N	\N	\N	http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4VipdKxUP8M/S9MoFCXRYHI/AAAAAAAAAWI/FOD1i_6D1zw/s1600/manet-portrait-of-emile-zola-1875.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89douard_Manet	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg",

511	Realism	Realism in the arts may be generally defined as the attempt to represent subject matter truthfully, without artificiality and avoiding artistic conventions, implausible, exotic and supernatural elements. The term originated in the 19th century, and was used to describe the work of Gustave Courbet and a group of painters who rejected idealization, focusing instead on everyday life.\nIn its most specific sense, Realism was an artistic movement that began in France in the 1850s, after the 1848 Revolution. Realists rejected Romanticism, which had dominated French literature and art since the late 18th century. Realism revolted against the exotic subject matter and exaggerated emotionalism and drama of the Romantic movement. Instead it sought to portray real and typical contemporary people and situations with truth and accuracy, and not avoiding unpleasant or sordid aspects of life. Realist works depicted people of all classes in situations that arise in ordinary life, and often reflected the changes wrought by the Industrial and Commercial Revolutions. The popularity of such 'realistic' works grew with the introduction of photography — a new visual source that created a desire for people to produce representations which look “objectively real.”\nMore generally, realist works of art are those that, in revealing a truth, may emphasize the ugly or sordid, such as works of social realism, regionalism, or Kitchen sink realism. The movement even managed to impact on opera, where it is called Verismo, with contemporary working-class heroines such as Carmen, who works in a cigarette factory, and Mimi in La bohème.	\N	\N	\N	http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fXHglDGcWZg/TNuDd6aRntI/AAAAAAAAAgY/VvRrWKO2o4Q/s1600/Realism_-_Jean-Francois_Millet%25252C_The_Gleaners.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_(arts)	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/The_Song_of_the_Lark_%28Jules_Breton%2C_1884%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Quiringh_van_Brekelenkam_-_Interior_of_a_Tailor%27s_Shop_-_WGA03175.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Raffaelli_Pariser_Vorstadt.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Kurskaya_korennaya.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/La_familia_de_Carlos_IV.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Pekka_Halonen_-_Tienraivaajia_Karjalassa.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Pieta_z_Lubiaza.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Jean-Baptiste_Sim%C3%A9on_Chardin_017.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois_Millet_-_A_Norman_Milkmaid_at_Gr%C3%A9ville_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois_Millet_-_Gleaners_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois_Millet_-_The_Sower_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Gustave_Courbet_010.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Giacomo_Ceruti_-_Women_Working_on_Pillow_Lace_%28The_Sewing_School%29_-_WGA4672.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Gustave_Courbet_031.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Gustave_Courbet_018.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Honor%C3%A9_Daumier_%28French%2C_Marseilles_1808%E2%80%931879_Valmondois%29_-_The_Third-Class_Carriage_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Henri_BIVA%2C_ca_1905-06%2C_Matin_%C3%A0_Villeneuve%2C_Salon_1906_postcard_-_original_painting%2C_oil_on_canvas%2C_151.1_x_125.1_cm%2C_private_collection.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Ilia_Efimovich_Repin_%281844-1930%29_-_Volga_Boatmen_%281870-1873%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Hubert_von_Herkomer_-_Hard_Times.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Jean-Baptiste_Greuze_%28French_-_The_Laundress_%28La_Blanchisseuse%29_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Illarion_Michajlowitsch_Prjanischnikow_002.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Young_Girl_Reading_by_Jean-Baptiste-Camille_Corot_c1868.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/Wladimir_Jegorowitsch_Makowskij_001.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/William_Bell_Scott_-_Iron_and_Coal.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/The_Arnolfini_Portrait%2C_d%C3%A9tail_%282%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Sir_Luke_Fildes_-_The_widower_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Simon_Bening_%28Flemish_-_Gathering_Twigs_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Eilif_Peterssen-Laksefiskeren_%281889%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Edouard_Manet_025.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/Eyckbaptism.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/El_almuerzo%2C_by_Diego_Vel%C3%A1zquez.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Annibale_Carracci_-_Butcher%27s_Shop_-_WGA04409.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Brouwer%2C_Adriaen_-_Interior_of_a_Tavern_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Brooklyn_Museum_-_Fin_du_travail_%28The_End_of_the_Working_Day%29_-_Jules_Breton.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Frederic_Leighton_-_Cimabue%27s_Madonna_Carried_in_Procession_-_Google_Art_Project_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Fallen_Monarchs_1886_by_William_Bliss_Baker.jpg"]	f	cover
484	George Washington	George Washington (February 22, 1732 [O.S. February 11, 1731] – December 14, 1799) was the first President of the United States (1789–1797), the commander-in-chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He presided over the convention that drafted the United States Constitution, which replaced the Articles of Confederation and which remains the supreme law of the land.\nWashington was elected President as the unanimous choice of the electors in 1788, and he served two terms in office. He oversaw the creation of a strong, well-financed national government that maintained neutrality in the wars raging in Europe, suppressed rebellion, and won acceptance among Americans of all types. His leadership style established many forms and rituals of government that have been used since, such as using a cabinet system and delivering an inaugural address. Further, the peaceful transition from his presidency to that of John Adams established a tradition that continues into the 21st century. Washington was hailed as "father of his country" even during his lifetime.\nWashington was born into the provincial gentry of Colonial Virginia; his wealthy planter family owned tobacco plantations and slaves. After both his father and older brother died when he was young, Washington became personally and professionally attached to the powerful William Fairfax, who promoted his career as a surveyor and soldier. Washington quickly became a senior officer in the colonial forces during the first stages of the French and Indian War. Chosen by the Second Continental Congress in 1775 to be commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in the American Revolution, Washington managed to force the British out of Boston in 1776, but was defeated and almost captured later that year when he lost New York City. After crossing the Delaware River in the dead of winter, he defeated the British in two battles, retook New Jersey and restored momentum to the Patriot cause.\nBecause of his strategy, Revolutionary forces captured two major British armies at Saratoga in 1777 and Yorktown in 1781. Historians laud Washington for his selection and supervision of his generals, encouragement of morale and ability to hold together the army, coordination with the state governors and state militia units, relations with Congress and attention to supplies, logistics, and training. In battle, however, Washington was repeatedly outmaneuvered by British generals with larger armies. After victory had been finalized in 1783, Washington resigned as Commander-in-chief rather than seize power, proving his opposition to dictatorship and his commitment to American republicanism.\nDissatisfied with the weaknesses of the Continental Congress, in 1787 Washington presided over the Constitutional Convention that devised a new Federal government of the United States. Elected unanimously as the first President of the United States in 1789, he attempted to bring rival factions together to unify the nation. He supported Alexander Hamilton's programs to pay off all state and national debt, to implement an effective tax system and to create a national bank (despite opposition from Thomas Jefferson).\nWashington proclaimed the United States neutral in the wars raging in Europe after 1793. He avoided war with Great Britain and guaranteed a decade of peace and profitable trade by securing the Jay Treaty in 1795, despite intense opposition from the Jeffersonians. Although he never officially joined the Federalist Party, he supported its programs. Washington's Farewell Address was an influential primer on republican virtue and a warning against partisanship, sectionalism, and involvement in foreign wars. He retired from the presidency in 1797 and returned to his home, Mount Vernon, and his domestic life where he managed a variety of enterprises. He freed all his slaves by his final will.\nWashington had a vision of a great and powerful nation that would be built on republican lines using federal power. He sought to use the national government to preserve liberty, improve infrastructure, open the western lands, promote commerce, found a permanent capital, reduce regional tensions and promote a spirit of American nationalism. At his death, Washington was eulogized as "first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen" by Henry Lee.\nThe Federalists made him the symbol of their party but for many years, the Jeffersonians continued to distrust his influence and delayed building the Washington Monument. As the leader of the first successful revolution against a colonial empire in world history, Washington became an international icon for liberation and nationalism, especially in France and Latin America. He is consistently ranked among the top three presidents of the United States, according to polls of both scholars and the general public.	\N	\N	\N	http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dc4-LguWhaA/TVVvIPvNy2I/AAAAAAAAD5g/QZCnUTSmCvs/s1600/George_Washington_1795.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Washington_1895_Issue-2c.jpg",

239	Marie Antoinette	Marie Antoinette (/məˈriː æntwəˈnɛt/ or /æntwɑːˈnɛt/; French: [maʁi ɑ̃twanɛt]; baptised Maria Antonia Josepha (or Josephina) Johanna; 2 November 1755 – 16 October 1793), born an Archduchess of Austria, was Dauphine of France from 1770 to 1774 and Queen of France and Navarre from 1774 to 1792. She was the fifteenth and penultimate child of Holy Roman Empress Maria Theresa and Emperor Francis I.\nIn April 1770, upon her marriage to Louis-Auguste, Dauphin of France, she became Dauphine of France. She assumed the title Queen of France and of Navarre when her husband ascended the throne as Louis XVI upon the death of his grandfather Louis XV in May 1774. After seven years of marriage, she gave birth to a daughter, Marie-Thérèse Charlotte, the first of four children.\nInitially charmed by her personality and beauty, the French people eventually came to dislike her, accusing "L'Autrichienne" (which literally means the Austrian (woman), but also suggests the French word "chienne", meaning bitch) of being profligate, promiscuous, and of harbouring sympathies for France's enemies, particularly Austria, her country of origin. The Diamond Necklace incident damaged her reputation further, although she was completely innocent in this affair. She later became known as Madame Déficit because France's financial crisis was blamed on her lavish spending.\nThe royal family's flight to Varennes had disastrous effects on French popular opinion: Louis XVI was deposed and the monarchy abolished on 21 September 1792; the royal family was subsequently imprisoned at the Temple Prison. Eight months after her husband's execution, Marie Antoinette was herself tried, convicted by the Revolutionary Tribunal of treason to the principles of the revolution, and executed by guillotine on 16 October 1793.\nLong after her death, Marie Antoinette is often considered to be a part of popular culture and a major historical figure, being the subject of several books, films and other forms of media. Some academics and scholars have deemed her frivolous and superficial, and have attributed the start of the French Revolution to her; however, others have claimed that she was treated unjustly and that views of her should be more sympathetic.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Alexander_Kucharski%2C_La_Reine_Marie-Antoinette_%28ann%C3%A9es_1790%29.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Antoinette	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Queen%27s_garden_and_Hamlet_Versailles.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Royal_Monogram_of_Queen_Marie-Antoinette_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Marie_Antoinette_by_Joseph_Ducreux.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Marie_Antoinette_in_Muslin_dress.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Marie_Antoinette_%C3%A0_la_paysan.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Prinsenvlag.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Marie_Antoinette_1767.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Marie_Antoinette_Adult.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Marie_Antoinette_Adult7.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Marie_Antoinette_Young4.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Lebr04.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Jacques-Louis_David_-_Marie_Antoinette_on_the_Way_to_the_Guillotine.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Louis_XVI_et_Marie-Antoinette.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Louis_Auguste_Dauphin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Marie-AntoinetteSignature.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Marie-Antoinette%3B_koningin_der_Fransen.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Marie-Antoinette_par_Elisabeth_Vig%C3%A9e-Lebrun_-_1783.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Marie-Antoinette_dauphine_profil-en-medaillon.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/MarieAntoinette1788.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/MarieAntoinette1769-70.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/The_Tuilleries%2C_20th_June_1792.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Sophie_Beatrice_of_France.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Royal_Standard_of_the_Kingdom_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Ferme1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Ex%C3%A9cution_de_Marie_Antoinette_le_16_octobre_1793.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Flag_of_Spain_%281785-1873_and_1875-1931%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Flag_of_Prussia_1892-1918.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Adolf_Ulrik_Wertm%C3%BCller_-_Queen_Marie_Antoinette_of_France_and_two_of_her_Children_Walking_in_The_Park_of_Trianon_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Execution_of_Louis_XVI.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Alexander_Kucharski%2C_La_Reine_Marie-Antoinette_%28ann%C3%A9es_1790%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Grand_Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg"]	f	70%
238	Louis XVI of France	Louis XVI (23 August 1754 – 21 January 1793) was King of France and Navarre from 1774 until 1791, after which he was subsequently King of the French from 1791 to 1792, before his deposition and execution during the French Revolution. His father, Louis, Dauphin of France, was the son and heir apparent of Louis XV of France. As a result of the Dauphin's death in 1765, Louis succeeded his grandfather in 1774.\nThe first part of Louis' reign was marked by attempts to reform France in accordance with Enlightenment ideals. These included efforts to abolish serfdom, remove the taille, and increase tolerance toward non-Catholics. The French nobility reacted to the proposed reforms with hostility, and successfully opposed their implementation; increased discontent among the common people ensued. From 1776 Louis XVI actively supported the North American colonists, who were seeking their independence from Great Britain, which was realized in the 1783 Treaty of Paris.\nThe ensuing debt and financial crisis contributed to the unpopularity of the Ancien Régime which culminated at the Estates-General of 1789. Discontent among the members of France's middle and lower classes resulted in strengthened opposition to the French aristocracy and to the absolute monarchy, of which Louis and his wife, queen Marie Antoinette, were viewed as representatives. In 1789, the storming of the Bastille during riots in Paris marked the beginning of the French Revolution.\nLouis's indecisiveness and conservatism led some elements of the people of France to view him as a symbol of the perceived tyranny of the Ancien Régime, and his popularity deteriorated progressively. His disastrous flight to Varennes in June 1791, four months before the constitutional monarchy was declared, seemed to justify the rumors that the king tied his hopes of political salvation to the prospects of foreign invasion. The credibility of the king was deeply undermined and the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of a republic became an ever increasing possibility.\nIn a context of civil and international war, Louis XVI was suspended and arrested at the time of the insurrection of 10 August 1792 one month before the constitutional monarchy was abolished and the First French Republic proclaimed on 21 September 1792. He was tried by the National Convention (self-instituted as a tribunal for the occasion), found guilty of high treason, and executed by guillotine on 21 January 1793 as a desacralized French citizen known as "Citizen Louis Capet", a nickname in reference to Hugh Capet, the founder of the Capetian dynasty – which the revolutionaries interpreted as Louis' family name. Louis XVI is the only King of France ever to be executed, and his death brought an end to more than a thousand years of continuous French monarchy.	\N	\N	\N	http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eMRrqb0GnTU/UP9cxgwvzLI/AAAAAAAAAHo/FkQ9TuLNbtU/s1600/Louis%2BXVI.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XVI_of_France	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Yorktown80.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Prinsenvlag.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Royal_Standard_of_the_Kingdom_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Signature_of_Louis_XVI.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Louis_XVI_et_La_P%C3%A9rouse.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Louis_XVI_et_Marie-Antoinette.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Louis_le_dernier3.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/PWranitzkySymphOp31TheRevolutionOrLaPaixFuneralMarchForTheDeathofLouisXVI.OGG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d6/Le_Couronnement_de_Louis_XVI_1775_Silver_Medallion.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Antoine-Fran%C3%A7ois_Callet_-_Louis_XVI%2C_roi_de_France_et_de_Navarre_%281754-1793%29%2C_rev%C3%AAtu_du_grand_costume_royal_en_1779_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Grand_Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Jacques_Bertaux_-_Prise_du_palais_des_Tuileries_-_1793_.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Grand_Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_France_%26_Navarre.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Louis16-1775.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Lebr04.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Louis_Charles_of_France2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/LouisXVI-France1.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Louis_XVI_at_the_Tour_du_Temple_Jean_Francois_Garneray_1755_1837.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Louis_XVI_Receives_the_Ambassadors_of_Tipu_Sultan_1788_Voyer_after_Emile_Wattier_19th_century.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/87/Louis_XVI_of_France_Coin.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Execution_of_Louis_XVI.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Duplessi-Bertaux_-_Arrivee_de_Louis_Seize_a_Paris.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Flag_of_Spain_%281785-1873_and_1875-1931%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Flag_of_Prussia_1892-1918.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Arms_of_the_French_Empire2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Coat_of_Arms_of_the_Dauphin_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Blason_duche_fr_Orleans_%28moderne%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/France_moderne.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg"]	f	70%
241	Nobles of the Robe	Under the Old Regime, the Nobles of the Robe or Nobles of the Gown (French: Noblesse de robe) were French aristocrats who owed their rank to judicial or administrative posts — often bought outright for high sums. As a rule, these positions did not grant the holder with a title (count, duke, baron, etc.), but were honorary positions almost always attached to a specific office (judge, councilor, etc.). The office was often hereditary and by 1789, most Nobles of the Robe had inherited their position. They were the opposite of the "Nobles of the Sword" (French: Noblesse d'épée) whose nobility was based on their families' traditional function as the military class, and whose titles were customarily attached to a fiefdom under the feudalist system. Together with the older nobility, Nobles of the Robe made up the Second Estate in pre-revolutionary France.	\N	\N	\N	http://thewallmachine.com/files/1357784765.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobles_of_the_Robe	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Charles-Alexandre_de_Calonne_-_Vig%C3%A9e-Lebrun_1784.jpg"]	f	contain
242	Estates General (France)	In France under the Old Regime, the States-General or Estates-General (French: états généraux, IPA: [eta ʒeneʁo]), was a legislative assembly (see The Estates) of the different classes (or estates) of French subjects. It had a separate assembly for each of the three estates, which were called and dismissed by the king. It had no true power in its own right—unlike the English parliament it was not required to approve royal taxation or legislation—instead it functioned as an advisory body to the king, primarily by presenting petitions from the various estates and consulting on fiscal policy. The Estates-General met intermittently until 1614 and rarely afterwards, but was not definitively dissolved until after the French Revolution.\nIt is comparable to similar institutions across Europe, such as the States-General of the Netherlands, the Parliament of England, the Estates of Parliament of Scotland, the Cortes of Spain, the Imperial Diet ("Reichstag") of the Holy Roman Empire or Germanic Empire, and the Diets (German: Landtage) of the "lands", historic states of Germany.	\N	\N	\N	http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KBiuMCzpv4s/UGEaa-WEI8I/AAAAAAAAAB0/QMbykSO7AUY/s1600/french%252Brev.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estates_General_(France)	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/62/PD-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Estatesgeneral.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Troisordres.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Les_trois_ordres_6986.jpg"]	f	cover
295	Bourgeoisie	Bourgeoisie (Eng.: /bʊərʒwɑːˈziː/; French pronunciation: ​[buʁʒwazi]) is a word from the French language, used in the fields of political economy, political philosophy, sociology, and history, which originally denoted the wealthy stratum of the middle class that originated during the latter part of the Middle Ages (AD 500–1500). The utilization and specific application of the word is from the realm of the social sciences. In sociology and in political science, the noun bourgeoisie and the adjective bourgeois are terms that describe a historical range of socio-economic classes. As such, in the Western world, since the late 18th century, the bourgeoisie describes a social class "characterized by their ownership of capital, and their related culture"; hence, the personal terms bourgeois (masculine) and bourgeoise (feminine) culturally identify the man or woman who is a member of the wealthiest social class of a given society, and their materialistic worldview (Weltanschauung).\nIn Marxist philosophy, the term bourgeoisie denotes the social class who owns the means of production and whose societal concerns are the value of property and the preservation of capital, in order to ensure the perpetuation of their economic supremacy in society. Joseph Schumpeter instead saw the creation of new bourgeoisie as the driving force behind the capitalist engine, particularly entrepreneurs who took risks in order to bring innovation to industries and the economy through the process of creative destruction.	\N	\N	\N	http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FvOWt-KZCRc/UZblL9YWaQI/AAAAAAAAFs4/CkMCFXogHCY/s1600/The-Exterminating-Angel-5835_3.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeoisie	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Thomas_Mann_in_1926.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/The_hand_that_will_rule_the_world.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Marx_and_Engels.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Luis_Bu%C3%B1uel.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Red_flag_II.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Moli%C3%A8re_-_Nicolas_Mignard_%281658%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Co-op_activism5.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Le-bourgeois-gentilhomme.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Fuggerkontor.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Symbol-hammer-and-sickle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Socrates.png"]	f	cover
361	Claude Monet	Oscar-Claude Monet (French: [klod mɔnɛ]; 14 November 1840 – 5 December 1926) was a founder of French Impressionist painting, and the most consistent and prolific practitioner of the movement's philosophy of expressing one's perceptions before nature, especially as applied to plein-air landscape painting. The term "Impressionism" is derived from the title of his painting Impression, soleil levant (Impression, Sunrise), which was exhibited in 1874 in the first of the independent exhibitions mounted by Monet and his associates as an alternative to the Salon de Paris.\nMonet's ambition of documenting the French countryside led him to adopt a method of painting the same scene many times in order to capture the changing of light and the passing of the seasons. From 1883 Monet lived in Giverny, where he purchased a house and property, and began a vast landscaping project which included lily ponds that would become the subjects of his best-known works. In 1899 he began painting the water lilies, first in vertical views with a Japanese bridge as a central feature, and later in the series of large-scale paintings that was to occupy him continuously for the next 20 years of his life.	\N	\N	\N	http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_uUMoLeG_fLM/TPefFwd-LkI/AAAAAAAAAlo/MXSbkhuz4Gc/s320/monet-impression-sunrise.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Monet	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Claude_Monet_The_Cliffs_at_Etretat.jpg",

487	Communes of France	The commune (French pronunciation: ​[kɔmyn]) is a level of administrative division in the French Republic. French communes are roughly equivalent to townships or incorporated municipalities in the United States or Gemeinden in Germany. French communes have no exact equivalent in the United Kingdom, but are closest to parishes. The communes are the sixth level administrative divisions of France. This makes France one of the few countries to have official sixth level administrative divisions.\nA French commune may be a city of two million inhabitants like Paris, a town of ten thousand people, or just a ten-person hamlet. Except for the municipal arrondissements of its largest cities, the communes are the lowest level of administrative division in France.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communes_of_France	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Panneau_Mittelhausbergen.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Logo_de_la_R%C3%A9publique_fran%C3%A7aise.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Panneau_Vacqueyras.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Alsace_Adve3.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/Comunne_Y_picardhiv68.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Communes_of_France.png"]	f	cover
485	National Assembly (France)	The National Assembly (French: Assemblée nationale; pronounced: [a.sɑ̃.ble.na.sjɔˈnal]) is the lower house of the bicameral Parliament of France under the Fifth Republic. The upper house is the Senate ("Sénat"). The National Assembly's members are known as députés (French pronunciation: ​[depyˈte]; "delegate" or "envoy" in English; the word is an etymological cognate of the English word "deputy", usually "adjoint" in French).\nThere are 577 députés, each elected by a single-member constituency through a two-rounds system. 289 seats are therefore required for a majority. The assembly is presided over by a president (currently Claude Bartolone), normally from the largest party represented, assisted by vice-presidents from across the represented political spectrum. The term of the National Assembly is five years; however, the President of the Republic may dissolve the Assembly (thereby calling for new elections) unless he has dissolved it in the preceding twelve months. This measure is becoming rarer since the 2000 referendum reduced the President's term from seven to five years: a President usually has a majority elected in the Assembly two months after him, and it would be useless for him to dissolve it for those reasons.\nFollowing a tradition started by the first National Assembly during the French Revolution, the "left-wing" parties sit to the left as seen from the president's seat, and the "right-wing" parties sit to the right, and the seating arrangement thus directly indicates the political spectrum as represented in the Assembly. The official seat of the National Assembly is the Palais Bourbon on the banks of the river Seine (48.861899°N 2.318605°E﻿ / 48.861899; 2.318605); the Assembly also uses other neighbouring buildings, including the Immeuble Chaban-Delmas on the rue de l'Université (48.860799°N 2.315902°E﻿ / 48.860799; 2.315902). It is guarded by Republican Guards.	\N	\N	\N	https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-L8WAKaD3ZnE/TWmb2Ol8M8I/AAAAAAAAABo/C3LRWGNbuyk/s1600/tableau.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(France)	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Steady2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Logo_de_l%27Assembl%C3%A9e_nationale_fran%C3%A7aise.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Jacques_Chaban-Delmas.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/National_Assembly_of_France_2012.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Martine_Billard_dsc07948.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Armoiries_r%C3%A9publique_fran%C3%A7aise.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Increase2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Decrease2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/01/A_coloured_voting_box.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Paris_assemble_nationale.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Panorama_de_l%27h%C3%A9micyle_de_l%27assembl%C3%A9e_nationale.jpg"]	f	cover
244	Tennis Court Oath	The Tennis Court Oath (French: Serment du jeu de paume) was a pivotal event during the first days of the French Revolution. The Oath was a pledge signed by 576 of the 577 members from the Third Estate who were locked out of a meeting of the Estates-General on 20 June 1789. The only person who did not sign was Joseph Martin-Dauch, a politician who would not execute decisions not sanctioned by the king. They made a makeshift conference room inside a tennis court located in the Saint-Louis district of the city of Versailles, near the Palace of Versailles.\nOn 17 June 1789, this group, led by Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, began to call themselves the National Assembly. On the morning of 20 June, the deputies were shocked to discover that the chamber door was locked and guarded by soldiers. Immediately fearing the worst and anxious that a royal attack by King Louis XVI was imminent, the deputies congregated in a nearby indoor tennis (Jeu de paume) court[citation needed] where they took a solemn collective oath "not to separate, and to reassemble wherever circumstances require, until the constitution of the kingdom is established". Some historians have argued that, given political tensions in France at that time, the deputies' fears, even if wrong, were reasonable and that the importance of the oath goes above and beyond its context.\nThe deputies pledged not to stop the meetings until the constitution had been written, despite the royal prohibition. The oath was both a revolutionary act, and an assertion that political authority derived from the people and their representatives rather than from the monarch himself. Their solidarity forced Louis XVI to order the clergy and the nobility to join with the Third Estate in the National Assembly in order to give the illusion that he controlled the National Assembly.	\N	\N	\N	http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fTAx3UY4LUg/Tq6cpHN5jvI/AAAAAAAAA8M/A_2TpCOPeuQ/s1600/tennis%252Bcourt%252Boath.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_Court_Oath	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Prinsenvlag.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Le_Serment_du_Jeu_de_paume.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Flag_of_Prussia_1892-1918.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Flag_of_Spain_%281785-1873_and_1875-1931%29.svg"]	f	cover
245	Bastille	The Bastille (French pronunciation: ​[bastij]) was a fortress in Paris, known formally as the Bastille Saint-Antoine. It played an important role in the internal conflicts of France and for most of its history was used as a state prison by the kings of France. It was stormed by a crowd on 14 July 1789 in the French Revolution, becoming an important symbol for the French Republican movement, and was later demolished and replaced by the Place de la Bastille.\nThe Bastille was built to defend the eastern approach to the city of Paris from the English threat in the Hundred Years' War. Initial work began in 1357, but the main construction occurred from 1370 onwards, creating a strong fortress with eight towers that protected the strategic gateway of the Porte Saint-Antoine on the eastern edge of Paris. The innovative design proved influential in both France and England and was widely copied. The Bastille figured prominently in France's domestic conflicts, including the fighting between the rival factions of the Burgundians and the Armagnacs in the 15th century, and the Wars of Religion in the 16th. The fortress was declared a state prison in 1417; this role was expanded first under the English occupiers of the 1420s and 1430s, and then under Louis XI in the 1460s. The defences of the Bastille were fortified in response to the English and Imperial threat during the 1550s, with a bastion constructed to the east of the fortress. The Bastille played a key role in the rebellion of the Fronde and the battle of the faubourg Saint-Antoine, which was fought beneath its walls in 1652.\nLouis XIV used the Bastille as a prison for upper-class members of French society who had opposed or angered him including, after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, French Protestants. From 1659 onwards, the Bastille functioned primarily as a state penitentiary; by 1789, 5,279 prisoners had passed through its gates. Under Louis XV and XVI, the Bastille was used to detain prisoners from more varied backgrounds, and to support the operations of the Parisian police, especially in enforcing government censorship of the printed media. Although inmates were kept in relatively good conditions, criticism of the Bastille grew during the 18th century, fueled by autobiographies written by former prisoners. Reforms were implemented and prisoner numbers were considerably reduced. In 1789 the royal government's financial crisis and the formation of the National Assembly gave rise to a swelling of republican sentiments among city-dwellers. On 14 July the Bastille was stormed by a revolutionary crowd, primarily residents of the faubourg Saint-Antoine who sought to commandeer the valuable gunpowder held within the fortress. Seven remaining prisoners were found and released and the Bastille's governor, Bernard-René de Launay, was killed by the crowd. The Bastille was demolished by order of the Committee of the Hôtel de Ville. Souvenirs of the fortress were transported around France and displayed as icons of the overthrow of despotism. Over the next century, the site and historical legacy of the Bastille featured prominently in French revolutions, political protests and popular fiction, and it remained an important symbol for the French Republican movement.\nAlmost nothing is left of the Bastille except some remains of its stone foundation that were relocated to the side of the Boulevard Henri IV. Historians were critical of the Bastille in the early 19th century, and believe the fortress to have been a relatively well-administered institution, but deeply implicated in the system of French policing and political control during the 18th century.\n\n	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Bastille_Courtyard_1785.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastille	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0c/Red_pog.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Pierre_de_la_bastille.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Scale_of_justice_2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Magnify-clip.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Memoires_sur_la_Bastille.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/P_parthenon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Paris_arr_jms.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Convulsionnaires_in_the_Bastille.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Eiffel_tower.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Episode_of_the_Fronde_at_the_Faubourg_Saint-Antoine_by_the_Walls_of_the_Bastille.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Losme_journal_page.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Bastille_floor_plan_labelled.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Bastille_district_1575.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Bastille_in_Medieval_Paris_Map..png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Bastille_foundations.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Bastille_profile%2C_1750.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Bastille_in_demolition_July_1789.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/Bastille_towers_profile.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Bastille_reconstruction_1420.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Callot_view_of_the_Bastille.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Bd_Henri_IV-_Vestige_de_la_Bastille.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Siege_of_the_Bastille_%28Claude_Cholat%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Bastille_1715.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Bastille_1649.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Bastille_1789.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Bastille_1719.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Attack_on_Bastille_plan.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Bastille%2C_1790_retouched.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Bastille%2C_1734.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Bastille_Interior_1785.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Bastille_Courtyard_1785.jpg"]	f	cover
363	Edgar Degas	Edgar Degas (French: [ilɛʁ ʒɛʁmɛ̃ ɛdɡɑʁ dəɡɑ]; US /deɪˈɡɑː/ or UK /ˈdeɪɡɑː/); born Hilaire-Germain-Edgar De Gas; (19 July 1834 – 27 September 1917) was a French artist famous for his paintings, sculptures, prints, and drawings. He is especially identified with the subject of dance; more than half of his works depict dancers. He is regarded as one of the founders of Impressionism, although he rejected the term, and preferred to be called a realist. He was a superb draftsman, and particularly masterly in depicting movement, as can be seen in his renditions of dancers, racecourse subjects and female nudes. His portraits are notable for their psychological complexity and for their portrayal of human isolation.\nAt the beginning of his career, he wanted to be a history painter, a calling for which he was well prepared by his rigorous academic training and close study of classic art. In his early thirties, he changed course, and by bringing the traditional methods of a history painter to bear on contemporary subject matter, he became a classical painter of modern life.	\N	\N	\N	http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_13TIX_DiYVQ/S98Nqa2rI3I/AAAAAAAAB30/xcAbfsZC3Cc/s320/degas.rehearsal%255B1%255D.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Degas	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/WLA_metmuseum_A_Woman_Seated_beside_a_Vase_of_Flowers_by_Edgar_Degas.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Edgar_Germain_Hilaire_Degas_029.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Edgar_Germain_Hilaire_Degas_031.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Edgar_Germain_Hilaire_Degas_011.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Edgar_Germain_Hilaire_Degas_013.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Edgar_Germain_Hilaire_Degas_019.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Edgar_Germain_Hilaire_Degas_025.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Edgar_Degas_self_portrait_1855.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Edgar_Degas_self_portrait_photograph.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Edgar_Germain_Hilaire_Degas_004.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Edgar_Germain_Hilaire_Degas_009.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Young_Spartans_National_Gallery_NG3860.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Edgar_Degas_-_Before_the_Race_-_Walters_37850.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Edgar_Degas_-_Ballet_Rehearsal_on_Stage_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Edgar_Degas_-_In_a_Caf%C3%A9_-_Google_Art_Project_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Edgar_Degas_-_Dance_Class.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Edgar_Degas_-_Mary_Cassatt_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Edgar_Degas_-_La_famille_Bellelli.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/Edgar_Degas_-_The_Ballet_Class_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Edgar_Degas_-_Orchestra_Musicians_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Edgar_Degas_Place_de_la_Concorde.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Edgar_Degas_-_Waiting_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Three_Dancers_in_Yellow_Skirts_Edgar_Degas.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/SpanishDance_c1884-DegasPC20080120-8849A.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Nuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Edgar_Germain_Hilaire_Degas_072.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Edgar_Germain_Hilaire_Degas_069.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Edgar_Germain_Hilaire_Degas_045.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Edgar_Germain_Hilaire_Degas_044.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Edgar_Germain_Hilaire_Degas_042.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Edgar_Germain_Hilaire_Degas_037.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Edgar_Germain_Hilaire_Degas_032.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Degas_-_Frau_mit_Stadtkost%C3%BCm.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Degas_-_Das_Ehepaar_Manet.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Edgar_Degas_%281834-1917%29_-_%27The_Bath-_Woman_Supporting_her_Back%27%2C_pastel_on_paper%2C_c._1887.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Edgar_Degas_%281834-1917%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Claude_Monet%2C_Impression%2C_soleil_levant%2C_1872.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Degas-dancer.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Cottonexchange1873-Degas.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Edgar_Degas_-_At_the_Races.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Edgar_Degas_-_Achille_De_Gas_in_the_Uniform_of_a_Cadet.jpg"]	f	cover
488	Jacobin	Jacobin is separate and distinct from Jacobite and Jacobian.\n\nThe Society of the Friends of the Constitution (French: Société des amis de la Constitution), commonly known as the Jacobin Club (Club des Jacobins, pronounced: [ʒa.kɔ.bɛ̃]) was the most famous and influential political club in the development of the French Revolution, so named because of the Dominican convent where they met, which had recently been located in the Rue St. Jacques (Latin: Jacobus), Paris. The club originated as the Club Benthorn, formed at Versailles from a group of Breton representatives attending the Estates General of 1789. There were thousands of chapters throughout France, with a membership estimated at 420,000.[citation needed] After the fall of Robespierre, the club was closed.\nThe club later became notorious for its implementation of the Reign of Terror. To this day, the terms Jacobin (/ˈdʒækəbɪn/) and Jacobinism are used as pejoratives for radical, left-wing revolutionary politics.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobin	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/62/PD-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/JacobinClubDoor.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Prinsenvlag.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Cl%C3%B4ture_de_la_salle_des_Jacobins_1794.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Flag_of_Spain_%281785-1873_and_1875-1931%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Flag_of_Prussia_1892-1918.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg"]	f	cover
486	Legislative Assembly (France)	The Legislative Assembly was the legislature of France from 1 October 1791 to September 1792 during the years of the French Revolution. It provided the focus of political debate and revolutionary law-making between the periods of the National Constituent Assembly and of the National Convention.\nThe Legislative Assembly was driven by two opposing groups. The members of the first group were primarily moderate members of the bourgeoisie (Wealthy middle class in 3rd Estate) that favored a constitutional monarchy, represented by the Feuillants, who felt that the revolution had already achieved its goal. The second group was the democratic faction, for whom the king could no longer be trusted, represented by the new members of the Jacobin club. This group claimed that more revolutionary measures were necessary.	\N	\N	\N	http://historymad.stmaryscollegehull.co.uk/3ContentPages/KS3/enemies/estaegnerel.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_Assembly_(France)	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/62/PD-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Prinsenvlag.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Flag_of_Prussia_1892-1918.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Flag_of_Spain_%281785-1873_and_1875-1931%29.svg"]	f	cover
251	National Convention	The National Convention (Convention nationale) — a single chamber assembly in France from 21 September 1792 to 26 October 1795 (4 Brumaire IV under the Convention's adopted calendar) during the French Revolution. It succeeded the Legislative Assembly and founded the First Republic after insurrection of 10 August 1792. The Legislative Assembly decreed the provisional suspension of King Louis XVI and the convocation of a National Convention which should draw up a constitution. At the same time it was decided that deputies to that convention should be elected by all Frenchmen 25 years old or more, domiciled for a year and living by the product of their labor. The National Convention was therefore the first French Assembly elected by universal male suffrage, without distinctions of class.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/1er_prairial_an_III.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Convention	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Le_D%C3%A9part_des_Volontaires_%28La_Marseillaise%29_par_Rude%2C_Arc_de_Triomphe_Etoile_Paris.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/62/PD-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/%C3%89lys%C3%A9e_blason.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Panth%C3%A9on_autel_Convention_nationale_1.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Constitution_de_la_R%C3%A9publique_Fran%C3%A7aise_du_5_fructidor_an_3_%2822_ao%C3%BBt_1795%29._D%C3%A9claration_des_Droits_et_des_Devoirs_de_l%27Homme_et_du_Citoyen.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Constitution_1793.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/ExaminationLouistheLast.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Death_of_Marat_by_David.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/13Vend%C3%A9miaire.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Max_Adamo_Sturz_Robespierres.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Armoiries_r%C3%A9publique_fran%C3%A7aise.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/1er_prairial_an_III.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/RiotsMay31-June2_1793.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Flag_of_Spain_%281785-1873_and_1875-1931%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Flag_of_Prussia_1892-1918.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Prinsenvlag.svg"]	f	cover
371	Fauvism	Fauvism is the style of les Fauves (French for "the wild beasts"), a loose group of early twentieth-century Modern artists whose works emphasized painterly qualities and strong color over the representational or realistic values retained by Impressionism. While Fauvism as a style began around 1900 and continued beyond 1910, the movement as such lasted only a few years, 1904–1908, and had three exhibitions. The leaders of the movement were Henri Matisse and André Derain.	\N	\N	\N	http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Yg3lYRZvzTo/TP-zqZhVfMI/AAAAAAAAA-0/EdNnX3kiiuQ/s1600/maurice-de-vlaminck-restaurant.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fauvism	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fb/Matisse-Woman-with-a-Hat.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/21/SeineChatou.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c4/Self-portrait_in_studio_by_Andr%C3%A9_Derain.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2d/Matisse_-_Green_Line.jpeg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/59/Matisse-Open-Window.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/58/La_Petite_Lima.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/83/Dongen-Hat.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8f/Henri_Matisse_Self-Portrait_in_a_Striped_T-shirt_%281906%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b5/Matisse_Souvenir_de_Biskra.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/07/Matisse-Luxe.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/05/Derain_CharingCrossBridge.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/be/Jean_Metzinger%2C_1907%2C_Paysage_color%C3%A9_aux_oiseaux_aquatique%2C_oil_on_canvas%2C_74_x_99_cm%2C_Mus%C3%A9e_d%E2%80%99Art_Moderne_de_la_Ville_de_Paris.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Rousseau-Hungry-Lion.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Wikinews-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Jean_Metzinger%2C_photo_published_in_1913.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/98/Matissetoits.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Portrait_of_Henri_Matisse_1933_May_20.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Les_Fauves%2C_Exhibition_at_the_Salon_D%27Automne%2C_from_L%27Illustration%2C_4_November_1905.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b9/Bonheur_Matisse.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Andr%C3%A9_Derain%2C_1905%2C_Le_s%C3%A9chage_des_voiles_%28The_Drying_Sails%29%2C_oil_on_canvas%2C_82_x_101_cm%2C_Pushkin_Museum%2C_Moscow._Exhibited_at_the_1905_Salon_d%27Automne.jpg"]	f	cover
252	Committee of Public Safety	The Committee of Public Safety (French: Comité de salut public), created in March 1793 by the National Convention and then restructured in July 1793, formed the de facto executive government in France during the Reign of Terror (1793–1794), a stage of the French Revolution. The Committee of Public Safety succeeded the previous Committee of General Defence (established in January 1793) and assumed its role of protecting the newly established republic against foreign attacks and internal rebellion. As a wartime measure, the Committee—composed at first of nine, and later of twelve members—was given broad supervisory powers over military, judicial, and legislative efforts. It was formed as an administrative body to supervise and expedite the work of the executive bodies of the Convention and of the government ministers appointed by the Convention. As the Committee tried to meet the dangers of a coalition of European nations and counter-revolutionary forces within the country, it became more and more powerful.\nIn July 1793, following the defeat at the Convention of the moderate Republicans (or "Girondists"), the prominent leaders of the radical Jacobins—Maximilien Robespierre, Saint-Just, and Georges Couthon—were added to the Committee. The power of the Committee peaked between August 1793 and July 1794, under the leadership of Robespierre. In December 1793, the Convention formally conferred executive power upon the Committee, and Robespierre established a virtual dictatorship.\nThe execution of Robespierre in July 1794 represented a reactionary period against the Committee of Public Safety and the excesses of the Reign of Terror. This is known as the Thermidorian Reaction, as Robespierre's fall from power occurred during the Revolutionary month of Thermidor. The Committee's influence diminished, and it was disestablished in 1795.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Comite_de_Salut_Public.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_of_Public_Safety	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lettre_anglaise.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Prinsenvlag.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Louis_Boilly_Robespierre.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Comite_de_Salut_Public.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Flag_of_Spain_%281785-1873_and_1875-1931%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Flag_of_Prussia_1892-1918.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg"]	f	cover
370	Paul Gauguin	Eugène Henri Paul Gauguin (French: [øʒɛn ɑ̃ʁi pol ɡoɡɛ̃]; 7 June 1848 – 8 May 1903) was a leading French Post-Impressionist artist who was not well appreciated until after his death. Gauguin was later recognized for his experimental use of colors and synthetist style that were distinguishably different from Impressionism. His work was influential to the French avant-garde and many modern artists, such as Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse. Gauguin’s art became popular after his death and many of his paintings were in the possession of Russian collector Sergei Shchukin. He was an important figure in the Symbolist movement as a painter, sculptor, print-maker, ceramist, and writer. His bold experimentation with coloring led directly to the Synthetist style of modern art, while his expression of the inherent meaning of the subjects in his paintings, under the influence of the cloisonnist style, paved the way to Primitivism and the return to the pastoral. He was also an influential proponent of wood engraving and woodcuts as art forms.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Gauguin_Stillleben_mit_Fruchtschale_und_Zitronen.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gauguin	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Paul_Gauguin_111.jpg",

254	Jean-Paul Marat	Jean-Paul Marat (French: [ʒɑ̃pɔl maʁa]; 24 May 1743 – 13 July 1793), born in the Principality of Neuchâtel, was a physician, political theorist and scientist best known for his career in France as a radical journalist and politician during the French Revolution. His journalism became renowned for its fierce tone, uncompromising stance toward the new leaders and institutions of the revolution, and advocacy of basic human rights for the poorest members of society.\nMarat was one of the most radical voices of the French Revolution. He became a vigorous defender of the sans-culottes, publishing his views in pamphlets, placards and newspapers, notably his "L'Ami du peuple", which helped make him their unofficial link with the radical, republican Jacobin group that came to power after June 1793.\nMarat was assassinated by Charlotte Corday, a Girondist sympathizer, while taking a medicinal bath for his debilitating skin condition. In his death Marat became an icon to the Jacobins, a sort of revolutionary martyr, as portrayed in David's famous painting of his death.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Jean-Paul_Marat_portre.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Marat	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/62/PD-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Triomphe_de_Marat4.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Jean-Paul_Marat_portre.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Jacques-Louis_David_-_La_Mort_de_Marat.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Prinsenvlag.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Flag_of_Prussia_1892-1918.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Flag_of_Spain_%281785-1873_and_1875-1931%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg"]	f	90%
255	Georges Danton	Georges Jacques Danton (French: [ʒɔʁʒ dɑ̃tɔ̃]; 26 October 1759 – 5 April 1794) was a leading figure in the early stages of the French Revolution and the first President of the Committee of Public Safety. Danton's role in the onset of the Revolution has been disputed; many historians describe him as "the chief force in the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the First French Republic". A moderating influence on the Jacobins, he was guillotined by the advocates of revolutionary terror after accusations of venality and leniency to the enemies of the Revolution.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Georges_Danton.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Danton	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/62/PD-icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Flag_of_Spain_%281785-1873_and_1875-1931%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/GeorgesDantonSignature.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Georges-Jacques_Danton.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/DantonSpeaking.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Flag_of_Prussia_1892-1918.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/FR-65440_statdanton01.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Prinsenvlag.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Georges_Danton.jpg"]	f	70%
257	Thermidorian Reaction	The Thermidorian Reaction was a revolt in the French Revolution against the excesses of the Reign of Terror. It was triggered by a vote of the National Convention to execute Maximilien Robespierre, Louis Antoine de Saint-Just, and several other leading members of the Terror. This ended the most radical phase of the French Revolution.\nThe name Thermidorian refers to 9 Thermidor Year II (27 July 1794), the date according to the French Revolutionary Calendar when Robespierre and other radical revolutionaries came under concerted attack in the National Convention. Thermidorian Reaction also refers to the remaining period until the National Convention was superseded by the Directory; this is also sometimes called the era of the Thermidorian Convention. Prominent figures of Thermidor include Paul Barras, Jean-Lambert Tallien, and Joseph Fouché.	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Valery_Jacobi_Ninth_Thermidor.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermidorian_Reaction	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Flag_of_Spain_%281785-1873_and_1875-1931%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Shot.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Prinsenvlag.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Cl%C3%B4ture_de_la_salle_des_Jacobins_1794.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Flag_of_Prussia_1892-1918.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Execution_robespierre%2C_saint_just....jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Valery_Jacobi_Ninth_Thermidor.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg"]	f	cover
261	Napoleonic Code	The Napoleonic Code ‒ or Code Napoléon (the official name being the Code civil des Français) ‒ is the French civil code established under Napoléon I in 1804. The code forbade privileges based on birth, allowed freedom of religion, and specified that government jobs should go to the most qualified.\nIt was drafted rapidly by a commission of four eminent jurists and entered into force on 21 March 1804. The Code, with its stress on clearly written and accessible law, was a major step in replacing the previous patchwork of feudal laws. Historian Robert Holtman regards it as one of the few documents that have influenced the whole world.\nThe Napoleonic Code was not the first legal code to be established in a European country with a civil legal system; it was preceded by the Codex Maximilianeus bavaricus civilis (Bavaria, 1756), the Allgemeines Landrecht (Prussia, 1794), and the West Galician Code (Galicia, then part of Austria, 1797). It was, however, the first modern legal code to be adopted with a pan-European scope, and it strongly influenced the law of many of the countries formed during and after the Napoleonic Wars. The Napoleonic Code was very influential on developing countries outside of Europe, especially in the Middle East, that were attempting to modernize their country through legal reforms.	\N	\N	\N	http://www.voyagesphotosmanu.com/Complet/images/Code_of_Napoleon.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Code	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Code_Civil_1804.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Speyer_%28DerHexer%29_2010-12-19_051.jpg"]	f	cover
263	Waterloo	In computing, a plug-in (or plugin, extension, or add-on / addon) is a software component that adds a specific feature to an existing software application. When an application supports plug-ins, it enables customization. The common examples are the plug-ins used in web browsers to add new features such as search-engines, virus scanners, or the ability to utilize a new file type such as a new video format. Well-known browser plug-ins include the Adobe Flash Player, the QuickTime Player, and the Java plug-in, which can launch a user-activated Java applet on a web page to its execution a local Java virtual machine.\nAdd-on (or addon) is the general term for what enhances an application. It comprises snap-in, plug-in, theme and skin. An extension add-on tailors the core features of an application by adding an optional module, whereas a plug-in add-on would tailor the outer layers of an application to personalize functionality.\nA theme or skin add-on is a preset package containing additional or changed graphical appearance details, achieved by the use of a graphical user interface (GUI) that can be applied to specific software and websites to suit the purpose, topic, or tastes of different users to customize the look and feel of a piece of computer software or an operating system front-end GUI (and window managers).	\N	\N	\N	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Battle_of_Waterloo_1815.PNG/640px-Battle_of_Waterloo_1815.PNG	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterloo	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/46/Plug-InExample.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Crystal_Clear_app_browser.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Mozilla_plugins_screenshot_without_subpixel_rendering.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Crystal_Clear_device_cdrom_unmount.png"]	f	cover
378	Claude Debussy	Achille-Claude Debussy (French: [aʃil klod dəbysi]; 22 August 1862 – 25 March 1918) was a French composer. Along with Maurice Ravel, he was one of the most prominent figures associated with Impressionist music, though he himself intensely disliked the term when applied to his compositions. In France, he was made Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1903. Debussy was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and his use of non-traditional scales and chromaticism influenced many composers who followed.\nDebussy's music is noted for its sensory content and frequent eschewing of tonality. The French literary style of his period was known as Symbolism, and this movement directly inspired Debussy both as a composer and as an active cultural participant.	\N	\N	\N	http://www.notablebiographies.com/images/uewb_04_img0223.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Debussy	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/La_Plus_Que_Lente.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Debussy_-_La_Mer_-_The_great_wave_of_Kanaga_from_Hokusai.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/Debussy%27s_house%2C_Sq._de_l%27av._Foch.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Debussy_1885.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Debussy_-_Mazurka.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Debussy_Le_Petit_Negre.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Debussy_1893.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Twenty_franc_banknote_claude_debussy.JPG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Gnome-mime-audio-openclipart.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Debussy_-_Syrinx.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Claude_Debussy_ca_1908%2C_foto_av_F%C3%A9lix_Nadar.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Claude_Debussy_by_Marcel_Baschet_1884.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Danse_Sacr%C3%A9e.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Danse_Profane.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/CELLO_LIVE_PERFORMANCES_JOHN_MICHEL-DEBUSSY_BEAU_SOIR.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Claude_Debussy_-_clair_de_lune.ogg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Caplet_Debussy.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Debussy%27s_grave.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Debussy%27s_chords_for_Guiraud.png"]	f	contain
294	Congress of Vienna	The Congress of Vienna was a conference of ambassadors of European states chaired by Austrian statesman Klemens Wenzel von Metternich, and held in Vienna from September 1814 to June 1815. The objective of the Congress was to provide a long-term peace for Europe by settling critical issues arising from the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. The goal was not simply to restore old boundaries, but to resize the main powers so they could balance each other off and remain at peace. The leaders were conservatives with little use for republicanism or revolution. France lost all its recent conquests, while Prussia, Austria and Russia made major territorial gains. Prussia added smaller German states in the west and 40% of Kingdom of Saxony; Austria gained Venice and much of northern Italy. Russia gained parts of Poland. The new kingdom of the Netherlands had been created just months before, and included formerly Austrian territory that in 1830 became Belgium.\nHistorian Paul Schroeder argues that the old formulas for "balance of power" were in fact highly destabilizing and predatory. He says the Congress of Vienna avoided them and instead set up rules that produced a stable and benign equilibrium. The Congress of Vienna was the first of a series of international meetings that came to be known as the Concert of Europe, which was an attempt to forge a peaceful balance of power in Europe. It served as a model for later organizations such as the League of Nations in 1919 and the United Nations in 1945.\n\nThe immediate background was Napoleonic France's defeat and surrender in May 1814, which brought an end to twenty-five years of nearly continuous war. Negotiations continued despite the outbreak of fighting triggered by Napoleon's dramatic return from exile and resumption of power in France during the Hundred Days of March–July 1815. The Congress's "Final Act" was signed nine days before his final defeat at Waterloo on 18 June 1815.\nIn a technical sense, the "Congress of Vienna" was not properly a Congress: it never met in plenary session, and most of the discussions occurred in informal, face-to-face, sessions among the Great Powers of Austria, Britain, France, Russia, and sometimes Prussia, with limited or no participation by other delegates. On the other hand, the Congress was the first occasion in history where, on a continental scale, national representatives came together to formulate treaties, instead of relying mostly on messengers and messages between the several capitals. The Congress of Vienna settlement, despite later changes, formed the framework for European international politics until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.	\N	\N	\N	http://leccos.com/pics/pic/vidensky_kongres.jpg	\N	Wikipedia.org	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Vienna	["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Talleyrand_02.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/PortugueseFlag1750.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d0/Clear.gif", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Flag_of_Spain_%281785-1873_and_1875-1931%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Flag_of_the_Kingdom_of_Prussia_%281803-1892%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Flag_of_the_Kingdom_of_France_%281814-1830%29.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Alkruger.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Congress_of_Vienna.PNG", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Berlin_.Gendarmenmarkt_.Deutscher_Dom_010.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Naval_Ensign_of_Sweden.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Map_congress_of_vienna.jpg"]	f	cover
